# The Human Gut Microbiome Atlas (HGMA) 

This repository is a store of code used for the production of the figures that were part of the study entitled: 'Global compositional and functional state of the human gut microbiome in health and disease' and for the corresponding webtool (https://www.microbiomeatlas.org/)

The codebase is organised as per the figures in the manuscript.

Requirements for each analysis are detailed within each analysis directory.
