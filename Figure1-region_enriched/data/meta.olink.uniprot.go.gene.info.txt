BMP6	P22004	ENSG00000153162	BMP6	P22004	bone morphogenetic protein 6	The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a family of secreted signaling molecules that can induce ectopic bone growth. Many BMPs are part of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB) superfamily. BMPs were originally identified by an ability of demineralized bone extract to induce endochondral osteogenesis in vivo in an extraskeletal site. Based on its expression early in embryogenesis, the BMP encoded by this gene has a proposed role in early development. In addition, the fact that this BMP is closely related to BMP5 and BMP7 has lead to speculation of possible bone inductive activity.

Numerous actions have been reported most related to the physiologic control of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. In the kidney, am is diuretic and natriuretic, and both am and pamp inhibit aldosterone secretion by direct adrenal actions. In pituitary gland, both peptides at physiologically relevant doses inhibit basal ACTH secretion. Both peptides appear to act in brain and pituitary gland to facilitate the loss of plasma volume, actions which complement their hypotensive effects in blood vessels.	20420	Secreted	Cellular component - Secreted,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Domain - Signal,Molecular function - Hormone,PTM - Amidation,PTM - Cleavage on pair of basic residues,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Direct protein sequencing,Technical term - Reference proteome	CVD II	Cancer-related genes, Plasma proteins, Predicted intracellular proteins, Predicted secreted proteins	Expressed in all		signaling molecule	Signal Transduction	GO:0001525 - angiogenesis;GO:0006915 - apoptotic process;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0009058 - biosynthetic process;GO:0048514 - blood vessel morphogenesis;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0008219 - cell death;GO:0030154 - cell differentiation;GO:0008283 - cell proliferation;GO:0016043 - cellular component organization;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0033554 - cellular response to stress;GO:0048878 - chemical homeostasis;GO:0032502 - developmental process;GO:0040007 - growth;GO:0007507 - heart development;GO:0046879 - hormone secretion;GO:0006959 - humoral immune response;GO:0006955 - immune response;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0035556 - intracellular signal transduction;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0022008 - neurogenesis;GO:0042127 - regulation of cell proliferation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0000003 - reproduction;GO:0001666 - response to hypoxia;GO:0043434 - response to peptide hormone;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0046903 - secretion;GO:0007165 - signal transduction;GO:0006810 - transport	GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0005737 - cytoplasm;GO:0005829 - cytosol;GO:0005576 - extracellular region;GO:0005615 - extracellular space

SLAM receptors triggered by homo- or heterotypic cell-cell interactions are modulating the activation and differentiation of a wide variety of immune cells and thus are involved in the regulation and interconnection of both innate and adaptive immune response. Activities are controlled by presence or absence of small cytoplasmic adapter proteins, SH2D1A/SAP and/or SH2D1B/EAT-2. Isoform 1 mediates NK cell activation through a SH2D1A-independent extracellular signal-regulated ERK-mediated pathway (PubMed:11698418). Positively regulates NK cell functions by a mechanism dependent on phosphorylated SH2D1B. Downstream signaling implicates PLCG1, PLCG2 and PI3K (PubMed:16339536). In addition to heterotypic NK cells-target cells interactions also homotypic interactions between NK cells may contribute to activation. However, in the absence of SH2D1B, inhibits NK cell function. Acts also inhibitory in T-cells (By similarity). May play a role in lymphocyte adhesion (PubMed:11802771). In LPS-activated monocytes negatively regulates production of proinflammatory cytokines (PubMed:23695528).,Isoform 3 does not mediate any NK cell activation.	37421	Membrane	Biological process - Immunity,Biological process - Innate immunity,Biological process - Adaptive immunity,Cellular component - Membrane,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Domain - Immunoglobulin domain,Domain - Signal,Domain - Transmembrane,Domain - Transmembrane helix,Molecular function - Receptor,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Direct protein sequencing,Technical term - Reference proteome	CVD II	CD markers, Predicted intracellular proteins, Predicted membrane proteins, Predicted secreted proteins	Mixed		cell adhesion molecule; defense/immunity protein; signaling molecule; transferase; kinase; receptor	Immune System	GO:0002250 - adaptive immune response;GO:0022610 - biological adhesion;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0001775 - cell activation;GO:0007155 - cell adhesion;GO:0001906 - cell killing;GO:0006955 - immune response;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0045087 - innate immune response;GO:0001909 - leukocyte mediated cytotoxicity;GO:0046649 - lymphocyte activation;GO:0002228 - natural killer cell mediated immunity;GO:0050776 - regulation of immune response;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress		GO:0016021 - integral component of membrane;GO:0005886 - plasma membrane

SRC	P12931	ENSG00000197122	SRC	P12931,P12931,P12931,P12931	SRC proto-oncogene, non-receptor tyrosine kinase	This gene is highly similar to the v-src gene of Rous sarcoma virus. This proto-oncogene may play a role in the regulation of embryonic development and cell growth. The protein encoded by this gene is a tyrosine-protein kinase whose activity can be inhibited by phosphorylation by c-SRC kinase. Mutations in this gene could be involved in the malignant progression of colon cancer. Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]	111	Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src	SRC	Non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase which is activated following engagement of many different classes of cellular receptors including immune response receptors, integrins and other adhesion receptors, receptor protein tyrosine kinases, G protein-coupled receptors as well as cytokine receptors. Participates in signaling pathways that control a diverse spectrum of biological activities including gene transcription, immune response, cell adhesion, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, migration, and transformation. Due to functional redundancy between members of the SRC kinase family, identification of the specific role of each SRC kinase is very difficult. SRC appears to be one of the primary kinases activated following engagement of receptors and plays a role in the activation of other protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) families. Receptor clustering or dimerization leads to recruitment of SRC to the receptor complexes where it phosphorylates the tyrosine residues within the receptor cytoplasmic domains. Plays an important role in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization through phosphorylation of specific substrates such as AFAP1. Phosphorylation of AFAP1 allows the SRC SH2 domain to bind AFAP1 and to localize to actin filaments. Cytoskeletal reorganization is also controlled through the phosphorylation of cortactin (CTTN). When cells adhere via focal adhesions to the extracellular matrix, signals are transmitted by integrins into the cell resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of focal adhesion proteins, including PTK2/FAK1 and paxillin (PXN). In addition to phosphorylating focal adhesion proteins, SRC is also active at the sites of cell-cell contact adherens junctions and phosphorylates substrates such as beta-catenin (CTNNB1), delta-catenin (CTNND1), and plakoglobin (JUP). Another type of cell-cell junction, the gap junction, is also a target for SRC, which phosphorylates connexin-43 (GJA1). SRC is implicated in regulation of pre-mRNA-processing and phosphorylates RNA-binding proteins such as KHDRBS1. Also plays a role in PDGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT3, leading to increased DNA binding activity of these transcription factors. Involved in the RAS pathway through phosphorylation of RASA1 and RASGRF1. Plays a role in EGF-mediated calcium-activated chloride channel activation. Required for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) internalization through phosphorylation of clathrin heavy chain (CLTC and CLTCL1) at 'Tyr-1477'. Involved in beta-arrestin (ARRB1 and ARRB2) desensitization through phosphorylation and activation of ADRBK1, leading to beta-arrestin phosphorylation and internalization. Has a critical role in the stimulation of the CDK20/MAPK3 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade by epidermal growth factor. Might be involved not only in mediating the transduction of mitogenic signals at the level of the plasma membrane but also in controlling progression through the cell cycle via interaction with regulatory proteins in the nucleus. Plays an important role in osteoclastic bone resorption in conjunction with PTK2B/PYK2. Both the formation of a SRC-PTK2B/PYK2 complex and SRC kinase activity are necessary for this function. Recruited to activated integrins by PTK2B/PYK2, thereby phosphorylating CBL, which in turn induces the activation and recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the cell membrane in a signaling pathway that is critical for osteoclast function. Promotes energy production in osteoclasts by activating mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase. Phosphorylates DDR2 on tyrosine residues, thereby promoting its subsequent autophosphorylation. Phosphorylates RUNX3 and COX2 on tyrosine residues, TNK2 on 'Tyr-284' and CBL on 'Tyr-731'. Enhances DDX58/RIG-I-elicited antiviral signaling. Phosphorylates PDPK1 at 'Tyr-9', 'Tyr-373' and 'Tyr-376'. Phosphorylates BCAR1 at 'Tyr-128'. Phosphorylates CBLC at multiple tyrosine residues, phosphorylation at 'Tyr-341' activates CBLC E3 activity.

[provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]	122	Angiopoietin-1 receptor	TEK	Tyrosine-protein kinase that acts as cell-surface receptor for ANGPT1, ANGPT2 and ANGPT4 and regulates angiogenesis, endothelial cell survival, proliferation, migration, adhesion and cell spreading, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, but also maintenance of vascular quiescence. Has anti-inflammatory effects by preventing the leakage of proinflammatory plasma proteins and leukocytes from blood vessels. Required for normal angiogenesis and heart development during embryogenesis. Required for post-natal hematopoiesis. After birth, activates or inhibits angiogenesis, depending on the context. Inhibits angiogenesis and promotes vascular stability in quiescent vessels, where endothelial cells have tight contacts. In quiescent vessels, ANGPT1 oligomers recruit TEK to cell-cell contacts, forming complexes with TEK molecules from adjoining cells, and this leads to preferential activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the AKT1 signaling cascades. In migrating endothelial cells that lack cell-cell adhesions, ANGT1 recruits TEK to contacts with the extracellular matrix, leading to the formation of focal adhesion complexes, activation of PTK2/FAK and of the downstream kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1, and ultimately to the stimulation of sprouting angiogenesis. ANGPT1 signaling triggers receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues that then serve as binding sites for scaffold proteins and effectors. Signaling is modulated by ANGPT2 that has lower affinity for TEK, can promote TEK autophosphorylation in the absence of ANGPT1, but inhibits ANGPT1-mediated signaling by competing for the same binding site. Signaling is also modulated by formation of heterodimers with TIE1, and by proteolytic processing that gives rise to a soluble TEK extracellular domain. The soluble extracellular domain modulates signaling by functioning as decoy receptor for angiopoietins. TEK phosphorylates DOK2, GRB7, GRB14, PIK3R1; SHC1 and TIE1.	125830	Cell membrane,Cell junction,Cell junction,Focal adhesion,Cytoplasm,Cytoskeleton,Secreted	Biological process - Angiogenesis,Cellular component - Cytoskeleton,Cellular component - Membrane,Cellular component - Cytoplasm,Cellular component - Secreted,Cellular component - Cell junction,Cellular component - Cell membrane,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Disease - Disease mutation,Domain - EGF-like domain,Domain - Immunoglobulin domain,Domain - Repeat,Domain - Signal,Domain - Transmembrane,Domain - Transmembrane helix,Ligand - ATP-binding,Ligand - Nucleotide-binding,Molecular function - Kinase,Molecular function - Receptor,Molecular function - Transferase,Molecular function - Tyrosine-protein kinase,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Phosphoprotein,PTM - Ubl conjugation,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Direct protein sequencing,Technical term - Reference proteome	CVD II	Cancer-related genes, CD markers, Disease related genes, Enzymes, FDA approved drug targets, Plasma proteins, Predicted membrane proteins, Predicted secreted proteins, RAS pathway related proteins	Mixed			Developmental Biology; Hemostasis; Immune System; Signal Transduction	GO:0001525 - angiogenesis;GO:0006915 - apoptotic process;GO:0022610 - biological adhesion;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0048514 - blood vessel morphogenesis;GO:0007155 - cell adhesion;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0008219 - cell death;GO:0030154 - cell differentiation;GO:0016477 - cell migration;GO:0048870 - cell motility;GO:0008283 - cell proliferation;GO:0007166 - cell surface receptor signaling pathway;GO:0044085 - cellular component biogenesis;GO:0016043 - cellular component organization;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0032502 - developmental process;GO:0072577 - endothelial cell apoptotic process;GO:0043542 - endothelial cell migration;GO:0007507 - heart development;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0006954 - inflammatory response;GO:0035556 - intracellular signal transduction;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0000165 - MAPK cascade;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0016310 - phosphorylation;GO:0030155 - regulation of cell adhesion;GO:0042127 - regulation of cell proliferation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0042325 - regulation of phosphorylation;GO:0072001 - renal system development;GO:0001666 - response to hypoxia;GO:0043434 - response to peptide hormone;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0007165 - signal transduction	GO:0043167 - ion binding	GO:0016324 - apical plasma membrane;GO:0009925 - basal plasma membrane;GO:0016323 - basolateral plasma membrane;GO:0009986 - cell surface;GO:0005911 - cell-cell junction;GO:0005737 - cytoplasm;GO:0005856 - cytoskeleton;GO:0005576 - extracellular region;GO:0005925 - focal adhesion;GO:0005887 - integral component of plasma membrane;GO:0045121 - membrane raft;GO:0005902 - microvillus;GO:0005886 - plasma membrane

Alternative splicing generates additional isoforms of each of the five growth hormones, leading to further diversity and potential for specialization. This particular family member is expressed in the pituitary but not in placental tissue as is the case for the other four genes in the growth hormone locus.

[provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]	151	Tyrosine-protein kinase Mer	MERTK	Receptor tyrosine kinase that transduces signals from the extracellular matrix into the cytoplasm by binding to several ligands including LGALS3, TUB, TULP1 or GAS6. Regulates many physiological processes including cell survival, migration, differentiation, and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis). Ligand binding at the cell surface induces autophosphorylation of MERTK on its intracellular domain that provides docking sites for downstream signaling molecules. Following activation by ligand, interacts with GRB2 or PLCG2 and induces phosphorylation of MAPK1, MAPK2, FAK/PTK2 or RAC1. MERTK signaling plays a role in various processes such as macrophage clearance of apoptotic cells, platelet aggregation, cytoskeleton reorganization and engulfment. Functions in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) as a regulator of rod outer segments fragments phagocytosis. Plays also an important role in inhibition of Toll-like receptors (TLRs)-mediated innate immune response by activating STAT1, which selectively induces production of suppressors of cytokine signaling SOCS1 and SOCS3.	110249	Membrane	Cellular component - Membrane,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Disease - Disease mutation,Disease - Proto-oncogene,Disease - Retinitis pigmentosa,Domain - Immunoglobulin domain,Domain - Repeat,Domain - Signal,Domain - Transmembrane,Domain - Transmembrane helix,Ligand - ATP-binding,Ligand - Nucleotide-binding,Molecular function - Kinase,Molecular function - Receptor,Molecular function - Transferase,Molecular function - Tyrosine-protein kinase,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Phosphoprotein,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Reference proteome	CVD II	Disease related genes, Enzymes, Plasma proteins, Potential drug targets, Predicted intracellular proteins, Predicted membrane proteins	Tissue enhanced	adrenal gland: 46.5		Hemostasis	GO:0006915 - apoptotic process;GO:0022610 - biological adhesion;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0001775 - cell activation;GO:0007155 - cell adhesion;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0008219 - cell death;GO:0030154 - cell differentiation;GO:0016477 - cell migration;GO:0048870 - cell motility;GO:0007166 - cell surface receptor signaling pathway;GO:0016043 - cellular component organization;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0050817 - coagulation;GO:0032502 - developmental process;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0035556 - intracellular signal transduction;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0046649 - lymphocyte activation;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0016310 - phosphorylation;GO:0030168 - platelet activation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0000003 - reproduction;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0046903 - secretion;GO:0007165 - signal transduction;GO:0006810 - transport;GO:0042060 - wound healing	GO:0043167 - ion binding	GO:0005737 - cytoplasm;GO:0005615 - extracellular space;GO:0005887 - integral component of plasma membrane;GO:0001750 - photoreceptor outer segment;GO:0005886 - plasma membrane;GO:0016028 - rhabdomere

MMP9	P14780	ENSG00000100985	MMP9	P14780	matrix metallopeptidase 9	Proteins of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. Most MMP's are secreted as inactive proproteins which are activated when cleaved by extracellular proteinases. The enzyme encoded by this gene degrades type IV and V collagens. Studies in rhesus monkeys suggest that the enzyme is involved in IL-8-induced mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells from bone marrow, and murine studies suggest a role in tumor-associated tissue remodeling.

EPHB4	P54760	ENSG00000196411	EPHB4	P54760,Q96L35,P54760	EPH receptor B4	Ephrin receptors and their ligands, the ephrins, mediate numerous developmental processes, particularly in the nervous system. Based on their structures and sequence relationships, ephrins are divided into the ephrin-A (EFNA) class, which are anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage, and the ephrin-B (EFNB) class, which are transmembrane proteins. The Eph family of receptors are divided into 2 groups based on the similarity of their extracellular domain sequences and their affinities for binding ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands. Ephrin receptors make up the largest subgroup of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family. The protein encoded by this gene binds to ephrin-B2 and plays an essential role in vascular development. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]	108	Ephrin type-B receptor 4	EPHB4	Receptor tyrosine kinase which binds promiscuously transmembrane ephrin-B family ligands residing on adjacent cells, leading to contact-dependent bidirectional signaling into neighboring cells. The signaling pathway downstream of the receptor is referred to as forward signaling while the signaling pathway downstream of the ephrin ligand is referred to as reverse signaling. Together with its cognate ligand/functional ligand EFNB2 plays a central role in heart morphogenesis and angiogenesis through regulation of cell adhesion and cell migration. EPHB4-mediated forward signaling controls cellular repulsion and segregation form EFNB2-expressing cells. Plays also a role in postnatal blood vessel remodeling, morphogenesis and permeability and is thus important in the context of tumor angiogenesis.	108270	Cell membrane	Biological process - Angiogenesis,Cellular component - Membrane,Cellular component - Cell membrane,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Domain - Repeat,Domain - Signal,Domain - Transmembrane,Domain - Transmembrane helix,Ligand - ATP-binding,Ligand - Nucleotide-binding,Molecular function - Developmental protein,Molecular function - Kinase,Molecular function - Receptor,Molecular function - Transferase,Molecular function - Tyrosine-protein kinase,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Phosphoprotein,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Reference proteome	CVD III	Cancer-related genes, Enzymes, Plasma proteins, Predicted membrane proteins, Predicted secreted proteins	Expressed in all			Developmental Biology	GO:0001525 - angiogenesis;GO:0022610 - biological adhesion;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0048514 - blood vessel morphogenesis;GO:0007155 - cell adhesion;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0016477 - cell migration;GO:0048870 - cell motility;GO:0007166 - cell surface receptor signaling pathway;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0032502 - developmental process;GO:0043542 - endothelial cell migration;GO:0007507 - heart development;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0016310 - phosphorylation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0007165 - signal transduction	GO:0043167 - ion binding	GO:0005829 - cytosol;GO:0070062 - extracellular exosome;GO:0005576 - extracellular region;GO:0005887 - integral component of plasma membrane;GO:0005886 - plasma membrane

The perlecan protein is a large multidomain proteoglycan that binds to and cross-links many extracellular matrix components and cell-surface molecules. It has been shown that this protein interacts with laminin, prolargin, collagen type IV, FGFBP1, FBLN2, FGF7 and transthyretin, etc., and it plays essential roles in multiple biological activities.

ANPEP	P15144	ENSG00000166825	ANPEP	H0YKT6,H0YM04,P15144	alanyl (membrane) aminopeptidase	Aminopeptidase N is located in the small-intestinal and renal microvillar membrane, and also in other plasma membranes. In the small intestine aminopeptidase N plays a role in the final digestion of peptides generated from hydrolysis of proteins by gastric and pancreatic proteases. Its function in proximal tubular epithelial cells and other cell types is less clear. The large extracellular carboxyterminal domain contains a pentapeptide consensus sequence characteristic of members of the zinc-binding metalloproteinase superfamily. Sequence comparisons with known enzymes of this class showed that CD13 and aminopeptidase N are identical. The latter enzyme was thought to be involved in the metabolism of regulatory peptides by diverse cell types, including small intestinal and renal tubular epithelial cells, macrophages, granulocytes, and synaptic membranes from the CNS. Human aminopeptidase N is a receptor for one strain of human coronavirus that is an important cause of upper respiratory tract infections. Defects in this gene appear to be a cause of various types of leukemia or lymphoma. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]	153	Aminopeptidase N (AP-N)	ANPEP	Broad specificity aminopeptidase.

Ligand binding at the cell surface induces dimerization and autophosphorylation of AXL. Following activation by ligand, ALX binds and induces tyrosine phosphorylation of PI3-kinase subunits PIK3R1, PIK3R2 and PIK3R3; but also GRB2, PLCG1, LCK and PTPN11.

This receptor contains a death domain. It has been shown to play a central role in the physiological regulation of programmed cell death, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various malignancies and diseases of the immune system. The interaction of this receptor with its ligand allows the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex that includes Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), caspase 8, and caspase 10. The autoproteolytic processing of the caspases in the complex triggers a downstream caspase cascade, and leads to apoptosis. This receptor has been also shown to activate NF-kappaB, MAPK3/ERK1, and MAPK8/JNK, and is found to be involved in transducing the proliferating signals in normal diploid fibroblast and T cells. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described, some of which are candidates for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD).

The encoded protein undergoes an autocatalytic processing event with its prosegment in the ER and is constitutively secreted as an inactive protease into the extracellular matrix and trans-Golgi network. It is expressed in liver, intestine and kidney tissues and escorts specific receptors for lysosomal degradation. It plays a role in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. Mutations in this gene have been associated with autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

May prevent the recycling of LDLR from endosomes to the cell surface or direct it to lysosomes for degradation. Can induce ubiquitination of LDLR leading to its subsequent degradation (PubMed:18799458, PubMed:17461796, PubMed:18197702, PubMed:22074827). Inhibits intracellular degradation of APOB via the autophagosome/lysosome pathway in a LDLR-independent manner. Involved in the disposal of non-acetylated intermediates of BACE1 in the early secretory pathway (PubMed:18660751). Inhibits epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC)-mediated Na(+) absorption by reducing ENaC surface expression primarily by increasing its proteasomal degradation.

Expression of this gene is upregulated by the synthetic retinoid tazarotene and occurs in a wide variety of tissues. The active protein has several roles, including that as an adipokine and as an antimicrobial protein with activity against bacteria and fungi. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]	187	Retinoic acid receptor responder protein 2	RARRES2	Adipocyte-secreted protein (adipokine) that regulates adipogenesis, metabolism and inflammation through activation of the chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1). Its other ligands include G protein-coupled receptor 1 (GPR1) and chemokine receptor-like 2 (CCRL2). Positively regulates adipocyte differentiation, modulates the expression of adipocyte genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism and might play a role in angiogenesis, a process essential for the expansion of white adipose tissue. Also acts as a proinflammatory adipokine, causing an increase in secretion of proinflammatory and prodiabetic adipokines, which further impair adipose tissue metabolic function and have negative systemic effects including impaired insulin sensitivity, altered glucose and lipid metabolism, and a decrease in vascular function in other tissues. Can have both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties depending on the modality of enzymatic cleavage by different classes of proteases. Acts as a chemotactic factor for leukocyte populations expressing CMKLR1, particularly immature plasmacytoid dendritic cells, but also immature myeloid DCs, macrophages and natural killer cells. Exerts an anti-inflammatory role by preventing TNF/TNFA-induced VCAM1 expression and monocytes adhesion in vascular endothelial cells. The effect is mediated via inhibiting activation of NF-kappa-B and CRK/p38 through stimulation of AKT1/NOS3 signaling and nitric oxide production. Its dual role in inflammation and metabolism might provide a link between chronic inflammation and obesity, as well as obesity-related disorders such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Exhibits an antimicrobial function in the skin.	18618	Secreted	Biological process - Chemotaxis,Biological process - Differentiation,Biological process - Inflammatory response,Cellular component - Secreted,Domain - Signal,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Direct protein sequencing,Technical term - Reference proteome	CVD III	Plasma proteins, Predicted secreted proteins	Tissue enhanced	adrenal gland: 834.1;liver: 659.2			GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0009056 - catabolic process;GO:0030154 - cell differentiation;GO:0016477 - cell migration;GO:0048870 - cell motility;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0006935 - chemotaxis;GO:0032502 - developmental process;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0006954 - inflammatory response;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0016310 - phosphorylation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0042325 - regulation of phosphorylation;GO:0043434 - response to peptide hormone;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0046903 - secretion;GO:0006810 - transport	GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0070062 - extracellular exosome;GO:0031012 - extracellular matrix;GO:0005576 - extracellular region;GO:0031089 - platelet dense granule lumen

PLAU	P00749	ENSG00000122861	PLAU	S4R3G7,P00749,E7ET40	plasminogen activator, urokinase	This gene encodes a serine protease involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix and possibly tumor cell migration and proliferation. A specific polymorphism in this gene may be associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease and also with decreased affinity for fibrin-binding. This protein converts plasminogen to plasmin by specific cleavage of an Arg-Val bond in plasminogen. Plasmin in turn cleaves this protein at a Lys-Ile bond to form a two-chain derivative in which a single disulfide bond connects the amino-terminal A-chain to the catalytically active, carboxy-terminal B-chain. This two-chain derivative is also called HMW-uPA (high molecular weight uPA). HMW-uPA can be further processed into LMW-uPA (low molecular weight uPA) by cleavage of chain A into a short chain A (A1) and an amino-terminal fragment. LMW-uPA is proteolytically active but does not bind to the uPA receptor. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

CST5	P28325	ENSG00000170367	CST5	P28325	cystatin D	The cystatin superfamily encompasses proteins that contain multiple cystatin-like sequences. Some of the members are active cysteine protease inhibitors, while others have lost or perhaps never acquired this inhibitory activity. There are three inhibitory families in the superfamily, including the type 1 cystatins (stefins), type 2 cystatins and the kininogens. The type 2 cystatin proteins are a class of cysteine proteinase inhibitors found in a variety of human fluids and secretions. The cystatin locus on chromosome 20 contains the majority of the type 2 cystatin genes and pseudogenes. This gene is located in the cystatin locus and encodes a protein found in saliva and tears. The encoded protein may play a protective role against proteinases present in the oral cavity.

SLAMF1	Q13291	ENSG00000117090	SLAMF1	Q13291,Q96QJ2,W0HKK7	signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1	NULL	134	Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule	SLAMF1	Self-ligand receptor of the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family. SLAM receptors triggered by homo- or heterotypic cell-cell interactions are modulating the activation and differentiation of a wide variety of immune cells and thus are involved in the regulation and interconnection of both innate and adaptive immune response. Activities are controlled by presence or absence of small cytoplasmic adapter proteins, SH2D1A/SAP and/or SH2D1B/EAT-2. SLAMF1-induced signal-transduction events in T-lymphocytes are different from those in B-cells. Two modes of SLAMF1 signaling seem to exist: one depending on SH2D1A (and perhaps SH2D1B) and another in which protein-tyrosine phosphatase 2C (PTPN11)-dependent signal transduction operates. Initially it has been proposed that association with SH2D1A prevents binding to inhibitory effectors including INPP5D/SHIP1 and PTPN11/SHP-2 (PubMed:11806999). However, signaling is also regulated by SH2D1A which can simultaneously interact with and recruit FYN which subsequently phosphorylates and activates SLAMF1 (PubMed:12458214). Mediates IL-2-independent proliferation of activated T-cells during immune responses and induces IFN-gamma production (By similarity). Downstreaming signaling involves INPP5D, DOK1 and DOK2 leading to inhibited IFN-gamma production in T-cells, and PRKCQ, BCL10 and NFKB1 leading to increased T-cell activation and Th2 cytokine production (By similarity). Promotes T-cell receptor-induced IL-4 secretion by CD4(+) cells (By similarity). Inhibits antigen receptor-mediated production of IFN-gamma, but not IL-2, in CD4(-)/CD8(-) T-cells (By similarity). Required for IL-4 production by germinal centers T follicular helper (T(Fh))cells (By similarity). May inhibit CD40-induced signal transduction in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (PubMed:16317102). May play a role in a allergic responses and may regulate allergen-induced Th2 cytokine and Th1 cytokine secretion (By similarity). In conjunction with SLAMF6 controls the transition between positive selection and the subsequent expansion and differentiation of the thymocytic natural killer T (NKT) cell lineage. Involved in the peripheral differentiation of indifferent natural killer T (iNKT) cells toward a regulatory NKT2 type (By similarity). In macrophages involved in down-regulation of IL-12, TNF-alpha and nitric oxide in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (By similarity). In B-cells activates the ERK signaling pathway independently of SH2D1A but implicating both, SYK and INPP5D, and activates Akt signaling dependent on SYK and SH2D1A (By similarity). In B-cells also activates p38 MAPK and JNK1 and JNK2 (PubMed:20231852). In conjunction with CD84/SLAMF5 and SLAMF6 may be a negative regulator of the humoral immune response (By similarity).,(Microbial infection) Acts as a receptor for measles virus; also including isoform 4 (PubMed:10972291, PubMed:25710480). Involved in innate immune response against Gram-negative bacteria in macrophages; probably recognizes OmpC and/or OmpF on the bacterial surface, regulates phagosome maturation and recruitment of the PI3K complex II (PI3KC3-C2) leading to accumulation of PdtIns(3)P and NOX2 activity in the phagosomes (PubMed:20818396).	37231	Cell membrane,Secreted,Cell membrane	Biological process - Cell adhesion,Biological process - Immunity,Biological process - Innate immunity,Biological process - Phagocytosis,Biological process - Host-virus interaction,Biological process - Adaptive immunity,Cellular component - Membrane,Cellular component - Secreted,Cellular component - Cell membrane,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Domain - Immunoglobulin domain,Domain - Repeat,Domain - Signal,Domain - Transmembrane,Domain - Transmembrane helix,Molecular function - Receptor,Molecular function - Host cell receptor for virus entry,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Phosphoprotein,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Reference proteome	Inf	CD markers, Predicted membrane proteins, Predicted secreted proteins	Tissue enhanced	lymph node: 13.1;tonsil: 11.3	cell adhesion molecule; defense/immunity protein; signaling molecule; transferase; kinase; receptor		GO:0002250 - adaptive immune response;GO:0022610 - biological adhesion;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0001775 - cell activation;GO:0002263 - cell activation involved in immune response;GO:0007155 - cell adhesion;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0030154 - cell differentiation;GO:0008283 - cell proliferation;GO:0007166 - cell surface receptor signaling pathway;GO:0016043 - cellular component organization;GO:0051641 - cellular localization;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0033554 - cellular response to stress;GO:0050663 - cytokine secretion;GO:0032502 - developmental process;GO:0006955 - immune response;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0045087 - innate immune response;GO:0035556 - intracellular signal transduction;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0046649 - lymphocyte activation;GO:0000165 - MAPK cascade;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0002277 - myeloid dendritic cell activation involved in immune response;GO:0016310 - phosphorylation;GO:0030155 - regulation of cell adhesion;GO:0042127 - regulation of cell proliferation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0050776 - regulation of immune response;GO:0042325 - regulation of phosphorylation;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0046903 - secretion;GO:0007165 - signal transduction;GO:0042110 - T cell activation;GO:0002369 - T cell cytokine production;GO:0042098 - T cell proliferation;GO:0042088 - T-helper 1 type immune response;GO:0006810 - transport		GO:0009897 - external side of plasma membrane;GO:0070062 - extracellular exosome;GO:0016021 - integral component of membrane;GO:0045335 - phagocytic vesicle

IL-23 induces autoimmune inflammation and thus may be responsible for autoimmune inflammatory diseases and may be important for tumorigenesis.	37169	Secreted	Cellular component - Secreted,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Domain - Immunoglobulin domain,Domain - Signal,Molecular function - Cytokine,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Direct protein sequencing,Technical term - Reference proteome	Inf	Disease related genes, Plasma proteins, Predicted secreted proteins	Not detected		signaling molecule		GO:0002250 - adaptive immune response;GO:0006915 - apoptotic process;GO:0022610 - biological adhesion;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0009058 - biosynthetic process;GO:0001775 - cell activation;GO:0002263 - cell activation involved in immune response;GO:0007155 - cell adhesion;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0007049 - cell cycle;GO:0008219 - cell death;GO:0030154 - cell differentiation;GO:0001906 - cell killing;GO:0016477 - cell migration;GO:0048870 - cell motility;GO:0008283 - cell proliferation;GO:0051641 - cellular localization;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0071345 - cellular response to cytokine stimulus;GO:0051607 - defense response to virus;GO:0032502 - developmental process;GO:0040007 - growth;GO:0006955 - immune response;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0006954 - inflammatory response;GO:0045087 - innate immune response;GO:0035556 - intracellular signal transduction;GO:0046907 - intracellular transport;GO:0001909 - leukocyte mediated cytotoxicity;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0046649 - lymphocyte activation;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0002228 - natural killer cell mediated immunity;GO:0016310 - phosphorylation;GO:0030155 - regulation of cell adhesion;GO:0042127 - regulation of cell proliferation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0050776 - regulation of immune response;GO:0045088 - regulation of innate immune response;GO:0042325 - regulation of phosphorylation;GO:0000003 - reproduction;GO:0034341 - response to interferon-gamma;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0002347 - response to tumor cell;GO:0019233 - sensory perception of pain;GO:0007165 - signal transduction;GO:0042110 - T cell activation;GO:0002292 - T cell differentiation involved in immune response;GO:0001913 - T cell mediated cytotoxicity;GO:0042098 - T cell proliferation;GO:0042088 - T-helper 1 type immune response;GO:0006810 - transport	GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0005737 - cytoplasm;GO:0005576 - extracellular region;GO:0005615 - extracellular space;GO:0043514 - interleukin-12 complex;GO:0070743 - interleukin-23 complex;GO:0016020 - membrane

Chemokines form a superfamily of secreted proteins involved in immunoregulatory and inflammatory processes. The superfamily is divided into four subfamilies based on the arrangement of the N-terminal cysteine residues of the mature peptide. This chemokine, a member of the CC subfamily, displays chemotactic activity on resting T lymphocytes and monocytes, lower activity on neutrophils and no activity on activated T lymphocytes. The protein is also a strong suppressor of colony formation by a multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cell line. In addition, the product of this gene is a potent agonist of the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 1. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants that encode different isoforms.

This protein is proposed to be involved in specific calcium-dependent signal transduction pathways and its regulatory effect on cytoskeletal components may modulate various neutrophil activities. The protein includes an antimicrobial peptide which has antibacterial activity. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014]	175	Protein S100-A12	S100A12	S100A12 is a calcium-, zinc- and copper-binding protein which plays a prominent role in the regulation of inflammatory processes and immune response. Its proinflammatory activity involves recruitment of leukocytes, promotion of cytokine and chemokine production, and regulation of leukocyte adhesion and migration. Acts as an alarmin or a danger associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule and stimulates innate immune cells via binding to receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (AGER). Binding to AGER activates the MAP-kinase and NF-kappa-B signaling pathways leading to production of proinflammatory cytokines and up-regulation of cell adhesion molecules ICAM1 and VCAM1. Acts as a monocyte and mast cell chemoattractant. Can stimulate mast cell degranulation and activation which generates chemokines, histamine and cytokines inducing further leukocyte recruitment to the sites of inflammation. Can inhibit the activity of matrix metalloproteinases; MMP2, MMP3 and MMP9 by chelating Zn(2+) from their active sites. Possesses filariacidal and filariastatic activity. Calcitermin possesses antifungal activity against C.albicans and is also active against E.coli and P.aeruginosa but not L.monocytogenes and S.aureus.	10575	Secreted,Cytoplasm,Cytoplasm,Cytoskeleton,Cell membrane	Biological process - Immunity,Biological process - Inflammatory response,Biological process - Innate immunity,Cellular component - Cytoskeleton,Cellular component - Membrane,Cellular component - Cytoplasm,Cellular component - Secreted,Cellular component - Cell membrane,Domain - Repeat,Ligand - Calcium,Ligand - Copper,Ligand - Metal-binding,Ligand - Zinc,Molecular function - Antibiotic,Molecular function - Fungicide,Molecular function - Antimicrobial,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Direct protein sequencing,Technical term - Reference proteome	Inf	Cytoskeleton related proteins, Plasma proteins, Predicted intracellular proteins	Tissue enriched	bone marrow: 1636.6	signaling molecule; calcium-binding protein	Immune System	GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0009058 - biosynthetic process;GO:0001775 - cell activation;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0001906 - cell killing;GO:0016477 - cell migration;GO:0048870 - cell motility;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0006935 - chemotaxis;GO:0050663 - cytokine secretion;GO:0006955 - immune response;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0006954 - inflammatory response;GO:0045087 - innate immune response;GO:0035556 - intracellular signal transduction;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0000165 - MAPK cascade;GO:0045576 - mast cell activation;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0016310 - phosphorylation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0010468 - regulation of gene expression;GO:0042325 - regulation of phosphorylation;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0046903 - secretion;GO:0007165 - signal transduction;GO:0006810 - transport	GO:0043167 - ion binding;GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0005737 - cytoplasm;GO:0005856 - cytoskeleton;GO:0005829 - cytosol;GO:0005576 - extracellular region;GO:0005634 - nucleus;GO:0005886 - plasma membrane

It encodes a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome. Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is antiangiogenic. Expression of some isoforms derived from the AUG start codon is regulated by a small upstream open reading frame, which is located within an internal ribosome entry site.

Two subgroups of the CEA family, the CEA cell adhesion molecules and the pregnancy-specific glycoproteins, are located within a 1.2 Mb cluster on the long arm of chromosome 19. Eleven pseudogenes of the CEA cell adhesion molecule subgroup are also found in the cluster. The encoded protein was originally described in bile ducts of liver as biliary glycoprotein. Subsequently, it was found to be a cell-cell adhesion molecule detected on leukocytes, epithelia, and endothelia. The encoded protein mediates cell adhesion via homophilic as well as heterophilic binding to other proteins of the subgroup. Multiple cellular activities have been attributed to the encoded protein, including roles in the differentiation and arrangement of tissue three-dimensional structure, angiogenesis, apoptosis, tumor suppression, metastasis, and the modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses.

SDC1	P18827	ENSG00000115884	SDC1	P18827,E9PHH3,H7C1K4,P18827	syndecan 1	The protein encoded by this gene is a transmembrane (type I) heparan sulfate proteoglycan and is a member of the syndecan proteoglycan family. The syndecans mediate cell binding, cell signaling, and cytoskeletal organization and syndecan receptors are required for internalization of the HIV-1 tat protein. The syndecan-1 protein functions as an integral membrane protein and participates in cell proliferation, cell migration and cell-matrix interactions via its receptor for extracellular matrix proteins. Altered syndecan-1 expression has been detected in several different tumor types. While several transcript variants may exist for this gene, the full-length natures of only two have been described to date. These two represent the major variants of this gene and encode the same protein.

TGFBR2	P37173	ENSG00000163513	TGFBR2	P37173,P37173	transforming growth factor, beta receptor II (70/80kDa)	This gene encodes a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family and the TGFB receptor subfamily. The encoded protein is a transmembrane protein that has a protein kinase domain, forms a heterodimeric complex with another receptor protein, and binds TGF-beta. This receptor/ligand complex phosphorylates proteins, which then enter the nucleus and regulate the transcription of a subset of genes related to cell proliferation. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Marfan Syndrome, Loeys-Deitz Aortic Aneurysm Syndrome, and the development of various types of tumors. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been characterized. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]	112	TGF-beta receptor type-2 (TGFR-2)	TGFBR2	Transmembrane serine/threonine kinase forming with the TGF-beta type I serine/threonine kinase receptor, TGFBR1, the non-promiscuous receptor for the TGF-beta cytokines TGFB1, TGFB2 and TGFB3. Transduces the TGFB1, TGFB2 and TGFB3 signal from the cell surface to the cytoplasm and is thus regulating a plethora of physiological and pathological processes including cell cycle arrest in epithelial and hematopoietic cells, control of mesenchymal cell proliferation and differentiation, wound healing, extracellular matrix production, immunosuppression and carcinogenesis. The formation of the receptor complex composed of 2 TGFBR1 and 2 TGFBR2 molecules symmetrically bound to the cytokine dimer results in the phosphorylation and the activation of TGFRB1 by the constitutively active TGFBR2. Activated TGFBR1 phosphorylates SMAD2 which dissociates from the receptor and interacts with SMAD4. The SMAD2-SMAD4 complex is subsequently translocated to the nucleus where it modulates the transcription of the TGF-beta-regulated genes. This constitutes the canonical SMAD-dependent TGF-beta signaling cascade. Also involved in non-canonical, SMAD-independent TGF-beta signaling pathways.	64568	Cell membrane,Membrane raft	Biological process - Apoptosis,Biological process - Differentiation,Biological process - Growth regulation,Cellular component - Membrane,Cellular component - Cell membrane,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Disease - Disease mutation,Disease - Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer,Disease - Aortic aneurysm,Domain - Signal,Domain - Transmembrane,Domain - Transmembrane helix,Ligand - ATP-binding,Ligand - Magnesium,Ligand - Manganese,Ligand - Metal-binding,Ligand - Nucleotide-binding,Molecular function - Kinase,Molecular function - Receptor,Molecular function - Serine/threonine-protein kinase,Molecular function - Transferase,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Phosphoprotein,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Direct protein sequencing,Technical term - Reference proteome	ONC II	Cancer-related genes, Disease related genes, Enzymes, Plasma proteins, Potential drug targets, Predicted membrane proteins	Expressed in all		transferase; kinase; receptor	Signal Transduction	GO:0001525 - angiogenesis;GO:0006915 - apoptotic process;GO:0022610 - biological adhesion;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0048514 - blood vessel morphogenesis;GO:0001775 - cell activation;GO:0007155 - cell adhesion;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0008219 - cell death;GO:0030154 - cell differentiation;GO:0016049 - cell growth;GO:0016477 - cell migration;GO:0048870 - cell motility;GO:0008283 - cell proliferation;GO:0007166 - cell surface receptor signaling pathway;GO:0016043 - cellular component organization;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0032502 - developmental process;GO:0040007 - growth;GO:0007507 - heart development;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0046649 - lymphocyte activation;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0007219 - Notch signaling pathway;GO:0016310 - phosphorylation;GO:0030155 - regulation of cell adhesion;GO:0042127 - regulation of cell proliferation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0010468 - regulation of gene expression;GO:0042325 - regulation of phosphorylation;GO:0000003 - reproduction;GO:0042493 - response to drug;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0007165 - signal transduction;GO:0042110 - T cell activation;GO:0006810 - transport;GO:0042060 - wound healing	GO:0043167 - ion binding;GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0005901 - caveola;GO:0005829 - cytosol;GO:0009897 - external side of plasma membrane;GO:0016021 - integral component of membrane;GO:0045121 - membrane raft;GO:0005886 - plasma membrane;GO:0043235 - receptor complex;GO:0070022 - transforming growth factor beta receptor homodimeric complex

This gene encodes one of the two receptors of the VEGF. This receptor, known as kinase insert domain receptor, is a type III receptor tyrosine kinase. It functions as the main mediator of VEGF-induced endothelial proliferation, survival, migration, tubular morphogenesis and sprouting. The signalling and trafficking of this receptor are regulated by multiple factors, including Rab GTPase, P2Y purine nucleotide receptor, integrin alphaVbeta3, T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase, etc.. Mutations of this gene are implicated in infantile capillary hemangiomas. [provided by RefSeq, May 2009]	125	Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2)	KDR	Tyrosine-protein kinase that acts as a cell-surface receptor for VEGFA, VEGFC and VEGFD. Plays an essential role in the regulation of angiogenesis, vascular development, vascular permeability, and embryonic hematopoiesis. Promotes proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation of endothelial cells. Promotes reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Isoforms lacking a transmembrane domain, such as isoform 2 and isoform 3, may function as decoy receptors for VEGFA, VEGFC and/or VEGFD. Isoform 2 plays an important role as negative regulator of VEGFA- and VEGFC-mediated lymphangiogenesis by limiting the amount of free VEGFA and/or VEGFC and preventing their binding to FLT4. Modulates FLT1 and FLT4 signaling by forming heterodimers. Binding of vascular growth factors to isoform 1 leads to the activation of several signaling cascades. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and the activation of protein kinase C. Mediates activation of MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as well as of the AKT1 signaling pathway. Mediates phosphorylation of PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and activation of PTK2/FAK1.

It has tyrosine kinase activity. The insulin-like growth factor I receptor plays a critical role in transformation events. Cleavage of the precursor generates alpha and beta subunits. It is highly overexpressed in most malignant tissues where it functions as an anti-apoptotic agent by enhancing cell survival. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, May 2014]	129	Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor	IGF1R	Receptor tyrosine kinase which mediates actions of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1). Binds IGF1 with high affinity and IGF2 and insulin (INS) with a lower affinity. The activated IGF1R is involved in cell growth and survival control. IGF1R is crucial for tumor transformation and survival of malignant cell. Ligand binding activates the receptor kinase, leading to receptor autophosphorylation, and tyrosines phosphorylation of multiple substrates, that function as signaling adapter proteins including, the insulin-receptor substrates (IRS1/2), Shc and 14-3-3 proteins. Phosphorylation of IRSs proteins lead to the activation of two main signaling pathways: the PI3K-AKT/PKB pathway and the Ras-MAPK pathway. The result of activating the MAPK pathway is increased cellular proliferation, whereas activating the PI3K pathway inhibits apoptosis and stimulates protein synthesis. Phosphorylated IRS1 can activate the 85 kDa regulatory subunit of PI3K (PIK3R1), leading to activation of several downstream substrates, including protein AKT/PKB. AKT phosphorylation, in turn, enhances protein synthesis through mTOR activation and triggers the antiapoptotic effects of IGFIR through phosphorylation and inactivation of BAD. In parallel to PI3K-driven signaling, recruitment of Grb2/SOS by phosphorylated IRS1 or Shc leads to recruitment of Ras and activation of the ras-MAPK pathway. In addition to these two main signaling pathways IGF1R signals also through the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway (JAK/STAT). Phosphorylation of JAK proteins can lead to phosphorylation/activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins. In particular activation of STAT3, may be essential for the transforming activity of IGF1R. The JAK/STAT pathway activates gene transcription and may be responsible for the transforming activity. JNK kinases can also be activated by the IGF1R. IGF1 exerts inhibiting activities on JNK activation via phosphorylation and inhibition of MAP3K5/ASK1, which is able to directly associate with the IGF1R.,When present in a hybrid receptor with INSR, binds IGF1. PubMed:12138094 shows that hybrid receptors composed of IGF1R and INSR isoform Long are activated with a high affinity by IGF1, with low affinity by IGF2 and not significantly activated by insulin, and that hybrid receptors composed of IGF1R and INSR isoform Short are activated by IGF1, IGF2 and insulin. In contrast, PubMed:16831875 shows that hybrid receptors composed of IGF1R and INSR isoform Long and hybrid receptors composed of IGF1R and INSR isoform Short have similar binding characteristics, both bind IGF1 and have a low affinity for insulin.	154793	Cell membrane	Cellular component - Membrane,Cellular component - Cell membrane,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Disease - Disease mutation,Domain - Repeat,Domain - Signal,Domain - Transmembrane,Domain - Transmembrane helix,Ligand - ATP-binding,Ligand - Nucleotide-binding,Molecular function - Kinase,Molecular function - Receptor,Molecular function - Transferase,Molecular function - Tyrosine-protein kinase,PTM - Cleavage on pair of basic residues,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Phosphoprotein,PTM - Ubl conjugation,PTM - Disulfide bond,PTM - Isopeptide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Direct protein sequencing,Technical term - Reference proteome	ONC II	Cancer-related genes, CD markers, Disease related genes, Enzymes, FDA approved drug targets, Plasma proteins, Predicted intracellular proteins, Predicted membrane proteins, RAS pathway related proteins	Expressed in all			Signal Transduction	GO:0006915 - apoptotic process;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0009058 - biosynthetic process;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0008219 - cell death;GO:0016477 - cell migration;GO:0048870 - cell motility;GO:0008283 - cell proliferation;GO:0007166 - cell surface receptor signaling pathway;GO:0044085 - cellular component biogenesis;GO:0016043 - cellular component organization;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0033554 - cellular response to stress;GO:0006955 - immune response;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0035556 - intracellular signal transduction;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0000165 - MAPK cascade;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0016310 - phosphorylation;GO:0042127 - regulation of cell proliferation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0042325 - regulation of phosphorylation;GO:0043434 - response to peptide hormone;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0007165 - signal transduction	GO:0042562 - hormone binding;GO:0043167 - ion binding;GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0035867 - alphav-beta3 integrin-IGF-1-IGF1R complex;GO:0005887 - integral component of plasma membrane;GO:0043231 - intracellular membrane-bounded organelle;GO:0016020 - membrane;GO:0005886 - plasma membrane;GO:0043235 - receptor complex

Essential component of a neuregulin-receptor complex, although neuregulins do not interact with it alone. GP30 is a potential ligand for this receptor. Regulates outgrowth and stabilization of peripheral microtubules (MTs). Upon ERBB2 activation, the MEMO1-RHOA-DIAPH1 signaling pathway elicits the phosphorylation and thus the inhibition of GSK3B at cell membrane.

This membrane-bound protein has a neuregulin binding domain but not an active kinase domain. It therefore can bind this ligand but not convey the signal into the cell through protein phosphorylation. However, it does form heterodimers with other EGF receptor family members which do have kinase activity. Heterodimerization leads to the activation of pathways which lead to cell proliferation or differentiation. Amplification of this gene and/or overexpression of its protein have been reported in numerous cancers, including prostate, bladder, and breast tumors. Alternate transcriptional splice variants encoding different isoforms have been characterized. One isoform lacks the intermembrane region and is secreted outside the cell. This form acts to modulate the activity of the membrane-bound form. Additional splice variants have also been reported, but they have not been thoroughly characterized.

It encodes a type 1 membrane bound protease that is expressed in many tissues, including neuroendocrine, liver, gut, and brain. The encoded protein undergoes an initial autocatalytic processing event in the ER and then sorts to the trans-Golgi network through endosomes where a second autocatalytic event takes place and the catalytic activity is acquired. The product of this gene is one of the seven basic amino acid-specific members which cleave their substrates at single or paired basic residues. Some of its substrates include proparathyroid hormone, transforming growth factor beta 1 precursor, proalbumin, pro-beta-secretase, membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase, beta subunit of pro-nerve growth factor and von Willebrand factor. It is also thought to be one of the proteases responsible for the activation of HIV envelope glycoproteins gp160 and gp140 and may play a role in tumor progression.

EPHA2	P29317	ENSG00000142627	EPHA2	P29317	EPH receptor A2	This gene belongs to the ephrin receptor subfamily of the protein-tyrosine kinase family. EPH and EPH-related receptors have been implicated in mediating developmental events, particularly in the nervous system. Receptors in the EPH subfamily typically have a single kinase domain and an extracellular region containing a Cys-rich domain and 2 fibronectin type III repeats. The ephrin receptors are divided into 2 groups based on the similarity of their extracellular domain sequences and their affinities for binding ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands. This gene encodes a protein that binds ephrin-A ligands. Mutations in this gene are the cause of certain genetically-related cataract disorders.[provided by RefSeq, May 2010]	143	Ephrin type-A receptor 2	EPHA2	Receptor tyrosine kinase which binds promiscuously membrane-bound ephrin-A family ligands residing on adjacent cells, leading to contact-dependent bidirectional signaling into neighboring cells. The signaling pathway downstream of the receptor is referred to as forward signaling while the signaling pathway downstream of the ephrin ligand is referred to as reverse signaling. Activated by the ligand ephrin-A1/EFNA1 regulates migration, integrin-mediated adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of cells. Regulates cell adhesion and differentiation through DSG1/desmoglein-1 and inhibition of the ERK1/ERK2 (MAPK3/MAPK1, respectively) signaling pathway. May also participate in UV radiation-induced apoptosis and have a ligand-independent stimulatory effect on chemotactic cell migration. During development, may function in distinctive aspects of pattern formation and subsequently in development of several fetal tissues. Involved for instance in angiogenesis, in early hindbrain development and epithelial proliferation and branching morphogenesis during mammary gland development. Engaged by the ligand ephrin-A5/EFNA5 may regulate lens fiber cells shape and interactions and be important for lens transparency development and maintenance. With ephrin-A2/EFNA2 may play a role in bone remodeling through regulation of osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis.	108266	Cell membrane,Cell projection,Ruffle membrane,Cell projection,Lamellipodium membrane,Cell junction,Focal adhesion	Biological process - Angiogenesis,Biological process - Apoptosis,Biological process - Cell adhesion,Biological process - Differentiation,Biological process - Host-virus interaction,Cellular component - Membrane,Cellular component - Cell junction,Cellular component - Cell projection,Cellular component - Cell membrane,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Disease - Disease mutation,Disease - Cataract,Domain - Repeat,Domain - Signal,Domain - Transmembrane,Domain - Transmembrane helix,Ligand - ATP-binding,Ligand - Nucleotide-binding,Molecular function - Kinase,Molecular function - Receptor,Molecular function - Transferase,Molecular function - Tyrosine-protein kinase,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Phosphoprotein,PTM - Ubl conjugation,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Reference proteome	ONC II	Cancer-related genes, Disease related genes, Enzymes, FDA approved drug targets, Predicted membrane proteins, RAS pathway related proteins	Tissue enhanced	esophagus: 63.2		Developmental Biology	GO:0001525 - angiogenesis;GO:0006915 - apoptotic process;GO:0022610 - biological adhesion;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0048514 - blood vessel morphogenesis;GO:0007155 - cell adhesion;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0008219 - cell death;GO:0030154 - cell differentiation;GO:0016477 - cell migration;GO:0048870 - cell motility;GO:0008283 - cell proliferation;GO:0007166 - cell surface receptor signaling pathway;GO:0044085 - cellular component biogenesis;GO:0016043 - cellular component organization;GO:0051641 - cellular localization;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0033554 - cellular response to stress;GO:0006935 - chemotaxis;GO:0032502 - developmental process;GO:0043542 - endothelial cell migration;GO:0030855 - epithelial cell differentiation;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0035556 - intracellular signal transduction;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0000165 - MAPK cascade;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0022008 - neurogenesis;GO:0016310 - phosphorylation;GO:0030155 - regulation of cell adhesion;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0042325 - regulation of phosphorylation;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0007165 - signal transduction	GO:0043167 - ion binding;GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0009986 - cell surface;GO:0005913 - cell-cell adherens junction;GO:0005925 - focal adhesion;GO:0005887 - integral component of plasma membrane;GO:0005622 - intracellular;GO:0031258 - lamellipodium membrane;GO:0031256 - leading edge membrane;GO:0005886 - plasma membrane;GO:0032587 - ruffle membrane

Required for mammary gland differentiation, induction of milk proteins and lactation. Acts as cell-surface receptor for the neuregulins NRG1, NRG2, NRG3 and NRG4 and the EGF family members BTC, EREG and HBEGF. Ligand binding triggers receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues that then serve as binding sites for scaffold proteins and effectors. Ligand specificity and signaling is modulated by alternative splicing, proteolytic processing, and by the formation of heterodimers with other ERBB family members, thereby creating multiple combinations of intracellular phosphotyrosines that trigger ligand- and context-specific cellular responses. Mediates phosphorylation of SHC1 and activation of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Isoform JM-A CYT-1 and isoform JM-B CYT-1 phosphorylate PIK3R1, leading to the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and AKT1 and protect cells against apoptosis. Isoform JM-A CYT-1 and isoform JM-B CYT-1 mediate reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and promote cell migration in response to NRG1. Isoform JM-A CYT-2 and isoform JM-B CYT-2 lack the phosphotyrosine that mediates interaction with PIK3R1, and hence do not phosphorylate PIK3R1, do not protect cells against apoptosis, and do not promote reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration. Proteolytic processing of isoform JM-A CYT-1 and isoform JM-A CYT-2 gives rise to the corresponding soluble intracellular domains (4ICD) that translocate to the nucleus, promote nuclear import of STAT5A, activation of STAT5A, mammary epithelium differentiation, cell proliferation and activation of gene expression. The ERBB4 soluble intracellular domains (4ICD) colocalize with STAT5A at the CSN2 promoter to regulate transcription of milk proteins during lactation. The ERBB4 soluble intracellular domains can also translocate to mitochondria and promote apoptosis.	146808	Cell membrane,Nucleus,Mitochondrion	Biological process - Apoptosis,Biological process - Lactation,Biological process - Transcription,Biological process - Transcription regulation,Cellular component - Membrane,Cellular component - Mitochondrion,Cellular component - Nucleus,Cellular component - Cell membrane,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Disease - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,Disease - Disease mutation,Disease - Neurodegeneration,Domain - Repeat,Domain - Signal,Domain - Transmembrane,Domain - Transmembrane helix,Ligand - ATP-binding,Ligand - Nucleotide-binding,Molecular function - Activator,Molecular function - Developmental protein,Molecular function - Kinase,Molecular function - Receptor,Molecular function - Transferase,Molecular function - Tyrosine-protein kinase,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Phosphoprotein,PTM - Ubl conjugation,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Reference proteome	ONC II	Cancer-related genes, Disease related genes, Enzymes, FDA approved drug targets, Plasma proteins, Predicted intracellular proteins, Predicted membrane proteins	Group enriched	cerebral cortex: 3.6;fallopian tube: 11.6;heart muscle: 2.4;kidney: 3.5;salivary gland: 3.4;testis: 4.2;thyroid gland: 2.4		Developmental Biology; Immune System; Signal Transduction	GO:0006915 - apoptotic process;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0009058 - biosynthetic process;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0008219 - cell death;GO:0030154 - cell differentiation;GO:0016477 - cell migration;GO:0048870 - cell motility;GO:0008283 - cell proliferation;GO:0007166 - cell surface receptor signaling pathway;GO:0016043 - cellular component organization;GO:0051641 - cellular localization;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0032502 - developmental process;GO:0030855 - epithelial cell differentiation;GO:0040007 - growth;GO:0007507 - heart development;GO:0035556 - intracellular signal transduction;GO:0046907 - intracellular transport;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0000165 - MAPK cascade;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0022008 - neurogenesis;GO:0016310 - phosphorylation;GO:0042127 - regulation of cell proliferation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0010468 - regulation of gene expression;GO:0042325 - regulation of phosphorylation;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0046903 - secretion;GO:0007165 - signal transduction;GO:0006810 - transport;GO:0042060 - wound healing	GO:0043167 - ion binding;GO:0003676 - nucleic acid binding;GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0016323 - basolateral plasma membrane;GO:0005829 - cytosol;GO:0005576 - extracellular region;GO:0016021 - integral component of membrane;GO:0005759 - mitochondrial matrix;GO:0005739 - mitochondrion;GO:0005654 - nucleoplasm;GO:0005634 - nucleus;GO:0005886 - plasma membrane;GO:0043235 - receptor complex

It plays a role in mediating cell fate decisions during hematopoiesis. It may play a role in cell-to-cell communication. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]	160	Delta-like protein 1	DLL1	Transmembrane ligand protein of NOTCH1, NOTCH2 and NOTCH3 receptors that binds the extracellular domain (ECD) of Notch receptor in a cis and trans fashion manner (PubMed:11006133). Following transinteraction, ligand cells produce mechanical force that depends of a clathrin-mediated endocytosis, requiring ligand ubiquitination, EPN1 interaction, and actin polymerisation; these events promote Notch receptor extracellular domain (NECD) transendocytosis and triggers Notch signaling through induction of cleavage, hyperphosphorylation, and nuclear accumulation of the intracellular domain of Notch receptors (NICD) (By similarity). Is required for embryonic development and maintenance of adult stem cells in many different tissues and immune systeme; the DLL1-induced Notch signaling is mediated through an intercellular communication that regulates cell lineage, cell specification, cell patterning and morphogenesis through effects on differentiation and proliferation (PubMed:11581320). Plays a role in brain development at different level, namely by regulating neuronal differentiation of neural precursor cells via cell-cell interaction, most likely through the lateral inhibitory system in an endogenous level dependent-manner. During neocortex development, Dll1-Notch signaling transmission is mediated by dynamic interactions between intermediate neurogenic progenitors and radial glia; the cell-cell interactions are mediated via dynamic and transient elongation processes, likely to reactivate/maintain Notch activity in neighboring progenitors, and coordinate progenitor cell division and differentiation across radial and zonal boundaries. During cerebellar development, regulates Bergmann glial monolayer formation and its morphological maturation through a Notch signaling pathway. At the retina and spinal cord level, regulates neurogenesis by preventing the premature differentiation of neural progenitors and also by maintaining progenitors in spinal cord through Notch signaling pathway. Also controls neurogenesis of the neural tube in a progenitor domain-specific fashion along the dorsoventral axis. Maintains quiescence of neural stem cells and plays a role as a fate determinant that segregates asymmetrically to one daughter cell during neural stem cells mitosis, resulting in neuronal differentiation in Dll1-inheriting cell. Plays a role in immune systeme development, namely the development of all T-cells and marginal zone (MZ) B-cells (By similarity). Blocks the differentiation of progenitor cells into the B-cell lineage while promoting the emergence of a population of cells with the characteristics of a T-cell/NK-cell precursor (PubMed:11581320). Also plays a role during muscle development. During early development, inhibits myoblasts differentiation from the medial dermomyotomal lip and later regulates progenitor cell differentiation. Directly modulates cell adhesion and basal lamina formation in satellite cells through Notch signaling. Maintains myogenic progenitors pool by suppressing differentiation through down-regulation of MYOD1 and is required for satellite cell homing and PAX7 expression. During craniofacial and trunk myogenesis suppresses differentiation of cranial mesoderm-derived and somite-derived muscle via MYOD1 regulation but in cranial mesoderm-derived progenitors, is neither required for satellite cell homing nor for PAX7 expression. Also plays a role during pancreatic cell development. During type B pancreatic cell development, may be involved in the initiation of proximodistal patterning in the early pancreatic epithelium. Stimulates multipotent pancreatic progenitor cells proliferation and pancreatic growth by maintaining HES1 expression and PTF1A protein levels. During fetal stages of development, is required to maintain arterial identity and the responsiveness of arterial endothelial cells for VEGFA through regulation of KDR activation and NRP1 expression. Controls sprouting angiogenesis and subsequent vertical branch formation througth regulation on tip cell differentiation. Negatively regulates goblet cell differentiation in intestine and controls secretory fat commitment through lateral inhibition in small intestine. Plays a role during inner ear development; negatively regulates auditory hair cell differentiation. Plays a role during nephron development through Notch signaling pathway. Regulates growth, blood pressure and energy homeostasis (By similarity).	78056	Apical cell membrane,Cell junction,Adherens junction,Membrane raft	Biological process - Differentiation,Biological process - Notch signaling pathway,Cellular component - Membrane,Cellular component - Cell junction,Cellular component - Cell membrane,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Domain - EGF-like domain,Domain - Repeat,Domain - Signal,Domain - Transmembrane,Domain - Transmembrane helix,Molecular function - Developmental protein,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Phosphoprotein,PTM - Ubl conjugation,PTM - Disulfide bond,PTM - Isopeptide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Reference proteome	ONC II	Predicted membrane proteins	Expressed in all			Signal Transduction	GO:0001525 - angiogenesis;GO:0006915 - apoptotic process;GO:0022610 - biological adhesion;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0009058 - biosynthetic process;GO:0048514 - blood vessel morphogenesis;GO:0001775 - cell activation;GO:0002263 - cell activation involved in immune response;GO:0007155 - cell adhesion;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0008219 - cell death;GO:0030154 - cell differentiation;GO:0051301 - cell division;GO:0008283 - cell proliferation;GO:0007166 - cell surface receptor signaling pathway;GO:0016043 - cellular component organization;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0032502 - developmental process;GO:0060847 - endothelial cell fate specification;GO:0030855 - epithelial cell differentiation;GO:0040007 - growth;GO:0007507 - heart development;GO:0006955 - immune response;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0046649 - lymphocyte activation;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0022008 - neurogenesis;GO:0007219 - Notch signaling pathway;GO:0008217 - regulation of blood pressure;GO:0030155 - regulation of cell adhesion;GO:0042127 - regulation of cell proliferation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0010468 - regulation of gene expression;GO:0072001 - renal system development;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0007165 - signal transduction;GO:0006810 - transport	GO:0043167 - ion binding;GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0005912 - adherens junction;GO:0016324 - apical plasma membrane;GO:0031410 - cytoplasmic vesicle;GO:0005576 - extracellular region;GO:0005887 - integral component of plasma membrane;GO:0045121 - membrane raft;GO:0005886 - plasma membrane

TLR3	O15455	ENSG00000164342	TLR3	D6RA51,O15455,O15455	toll-like receptor 3	The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family which plays a fundamental role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity. TLRs are highly conserved from Drosophila to humans and share structural and functional similarities. They recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are expressed on infectious agents, and mediate the production of cytokines necessary for the development of effective immunity. The various TLRs exhibit different patterns of expression. This receptor is most abundantly expressed in placenta and pancreas, and is restricted to the dendritic subpopulation of the leukocytes. It recognizes dsRNA associated with viral infection, and induces the activation of NF-kappaB and the production of type I interferons. It may thus play a role in host defense against viruses. Use of alternative polyadenylation sites to generate different length transcripts has been noted for this gene.

The protein is thought to be involved in lymphangiogenesis and maintenance of the lymphatic endothelium. Mutations in this gene cause hereditary lymphedema type IA. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]	190	Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3)	FLT4	Tyrosine-protein kinase that acts as a cell-surface receptor for VEGFC and VEGFD, and plays an essential role in adult lymphangiogenesis and in the development of the vascular network and the cardiovascular system during embryonic development. Promotes proliferation, survival and migration of endothelial cells, and regulates angiogenic sprouting. Signaling by activated FLT4 leads to enhanced production of VEGFC, and to a lesser degree VEGFA, thereby creating a positive feedback loop that enhances FLT4 signaling. Modulates KDR signaling by forming heterodimers. The secreted isoform 3 may function as a decoy receptor for VEGFC and/or VEGFD and play an important role as a negative regulator of VEGFC-mediated lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis. Binding of vascular growth factors to isoform 1 or isoform 2 leads to the activation of several signaling cascades; isoform 2 seems to be less efficient in signal transduction, because it has a truncated C-terminus and therefore lacks several phosphorylation sites.

[provided by RefSeq, May 2014]	156	BDNF/NT-3 growth factors receptor	NTRK2	Receptor tyrosine kinase involved in the development and the maturation of the central and the peripheral nervous systems through regulation of neuron survival, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and synapse formation and plasticity. Receptor for BDNF/brain-derived neurotrophic factor and NTF4/neurotrophin-4. Alternatively can also bind NTF3/neurotrophin-3 which is less efficient in activating the receptor but regulates neuron survival through NTRK2. Upon ligand-binding, undergoes homodimerization, autophosphorylation and activation. Recruits, phosphorylates and/or activates several downstream effectors including SHC1, FRS2, SH2B1, SH2B2 and PLCG1 that regulate distinct overlapping signaling cascades. Through SHC1, FRS2, SH2B1, SH2B2 activates the GRB2-Ras-MAPK cascade that regulates for instance neuronal differentiation including neurite outgrowth. Through the same effectors controls the Ras-PI3 kinase-AKT1 signaling cascade that mainly regulates growth and survival. Through PLCG1 and the downstream protein kinase C-regulated pathways controls synaptic plasticity. Thereby, plays a role in learning and memory by regulating both short term synaptic function and long-term potentiation. PLCG1 also leads to NF-Kappa-B activation and the transcription of genes involved in cell survival. Hence, it is able to suppress anoikis, the apoptosis resulting from loss of cell-matrix interactions. May also play a role in neutrophin-dependent calcium signaling in glial cells and mediate communication between neurons and glia.	91999	Cell membrane,Endosome membrane	Biological process - Differentiation,Biological process - Neurogenesis,Cellular component - Membrane,Cellular component - Endosome,Cellular component - Cell membrane,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Disease - Disease mutation,Disease - Obesity,Domain - Immunoglobulin domain,Domain - Leucine-rich repeat,Domain - Repeat,Domain - Signal,Domain - Transmembrane,Domain - Transmembrane helix,Ligand - ATP-binding,Ligand - Nucleotide-binding,Molecular function - Developmental protein,Molecular function - Kinase,Molecular function - Receptor,Molecular function - Transferase,Molecular function - Tyrosine-protein kinase,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Phosphoprotein,PTM - Ubl conjugation,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Reference proteome	NEU I	Cancer-related genes, Disease related genes, Enzymes, Plasma proteins, Potential drug targets, Predicted membrane proteins	Tissue enhanced	cerebral cortex: 228.6;thyroid gland: 125.3		Signal Transduction	GO:0006915 - apoptotic process;GO:0061564 - axon development;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0048514 - blood vessel morphogenesis;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0008219 - cell death;GO:0030154 - cell differentiation;GO:0016477 - cell migration;GO:0048870 - cell motility;GO:0008283 - cell proliferation;GO:0007166 - cell surface receptor signaling pathway;GO:0044085 - cellular component biogenesis;GO:0016043 - cellular component organization;GO:0051641 - cellular localization;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0071345 - cellular response to cytokine stimulus;GO:0050890 - cognition;GO:0032502 - developmental process;GO:0006954 - inflammatory response;GO:0035556 - intracellular signal transduction;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0000165 - MAPK cascade;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0022008 - neurogenesis;GO:0016310 - phosphorylation;GO:0042127 - regulation of cell proliferation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0010468 - regulation of gene expression;GO:0042325 - regulation of phosphorylation;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0048511 - rhythmic process;GO:0046903 - secretion;GO:0007165 - signal transduction;GO:0007416 - synapse assembly;GO:0006810 - transport	GO:0043167 - ion binding;GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0009986 - cell surface;GO:0005829 - cytosol;GO:0043197 - dendritic spine;GO:0010008 - endosome membrane;GO:0030426 - growth cone;GO:0005887 - integral component of plasma membrane;GO:0043204 - perikaryon;GO:0014069 - postsynaptic density;GO:0045211 - postsynaptic membrane;GO:0048786 - presynaptic active zone;GO:0043235 - receptor complex;GO:0005791 - rough endoplasmic reticulum;GO:0043195 - terminal bouton

The external domain mediates cell attachment to the extracellular matrix molecule vitronectin, while its intracellular domain interacts with the dynein light chain Tctex-1/DYNLT1. The gene is specific to the primate lineage, and serves as a cellular receptor for poliovirus in the first step of poliovirus replication. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008]	162	Poliovirus receptor	PVR	Mediates NK cell adhesion and triggers NK cell effector functions. Binds two different NK cell receptors: CD96 and CD226. These interactions accumulates at the cell-cell contact site, leading to the formation of a mature immunological synapse between NK cell and target cell. This may trigger adhesion and secretion of lytic granules and IFN-gamma and activate cytoxicity of activated NK cells. May also promote NK cell-target cell modular exchange, and PVR transfer to the NK cell. This transfer is more important in some tumor cells expressing a lot of PVR, and may trigger fratricide NK cell activation, providing tumors with a mechanism of immunoevasion. Plays a role in mediating tumor cell invasion and migration.,(Microbial infection) Acts as a receptor for poliovirus. May play a role in axonal transport of poliovirus, by targeting virion-PVR-containing endocytic vesicles to the microtubular network through interaction with DYNLT1. This interaction would drive the virus-containing vesicle to the axonal retrograde transport (PubMed:2538245). Acts as a receptor for pseudorabies virus (PubMed:9616127). Is prevented to reach cell surface upon infection by human cytomegalovirus /HHV-5, presumably to escape immune recognition of infected cell by NK cells (PubMed:15640804).	45303	Cell membrane,Cell membrane,Secreted,Secreted	Biological process - Cell adhesion,Biological process - Host-virus interaction,Cellular component - Membrane,Cellular component - Secreted,Cellular component - Cell membrane,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Domain - Immunoglobulin domain,Domain - Repeat,Domain - Signal,Domain - Transmembrane,Domain - Transmembrane helix,Molecular function - Receptor,Molecular function - Host cell receptor for virus entry,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Phosphoprotein,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Reference proteome	NEU I	CD markers, Plasma proteins, Predicted intracellular proteins, Predicted membrane proteins, Predicted secreted proteins	Expressed in all		defense/immunity protein; receptor	Cell-Cell communication; Immune System	GO:0002250 - adaptive immune response;GO:0022610 - biological adhesion;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0007155 - cell adhesion;GO:0001906 - cell killing;GO:0016043 - cellular component organization;GO:0006955 - immune response;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0045087 - innate immune response;GO:0001909 - leukocyte mediated cytotoxicity;GO:0002228 - natural killer cell mediated immunity;GO:0050776 - regulation of immune response;GO:0045088 - regulation of innate immune response;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0002347 - response to tumor cell;GO:0001913 - T cell mediated cytotoxicity	GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0009986 - cell surface;GO:0005913 - cell-cell adherens junction;GO:0005737 - cytoplasm;GO:0070062 - extracellular exosome;GO:0005615 - extracellular space;GO:0005925 - focal adhesion;GO:0016021 - integral component of membrane;GO:0005887 - integral component of plasma membrane;GO:0005886 - plasma membrane

Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, mobilization of cytosolic Ca(2+) and the activation of protein kinase C. Phosphorylates PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and thereby mediates activation of the AKT1 signaling pathway. Mediates activation of HRAS and of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and/or MAPK3/ERK1. Promotes activation of STAT family members STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5A and/or STAT5B. Receptor signaling is down-regulated by protein phosphatases that dephosphorylate the receptor and its down-stream effectors, and by rapid internalization of the activated receptor.	122670	Cell membrane	Biological process - Chemotaxis,Biological process - Host-virus interaction,Cellular component - Membrane,Cellular component - Cell membrane,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Disease - Proto-oncogene,Domain - Immunoglobulin domain,Domain - Repeat,Domain - Signal,Domain - Transmembrane,Domain - Transmembrane helix,Ligand - ATP-binding,Ligand - Nucleotide-binding,Molecular function - Developmental protein,Molecular function - Kinase,Molecular function - Receptor,Molecular function - Transferase,Molecular function - Tyrosine-protein kinase,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Phosphoprotein,PTM - Ubl conjugation,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Reference proteome	NEU I	Cancer-related genes, CD markers, Disease related genes, Enzymes, FDA approved drug targets, Plasma proteins, Predicted intracellular proteins, Predicted membrane proteins, Predicted secreted proteins, RAS pathway related proteins	Tissue enhanced	ovary: 148.6		Developmental Biology; Immune System; Signal Transduction	GO:0001525 - angiogenesis;GO:0022610 - biological adhesion;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0009058 - biosynthetic process;GO:0048514 - blood vessel morphogenesis;GO:0001775 - cell activation;GO:0007155 - cell adhesion;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0030154 - cell differentiation;GO:0016477 - cell migration;GO:0048870 - cell motility;GO:0008283 - cell proliferation;GO:0007166 - cell surface receptor signaling pathway;GO:0044085 - cellular component biogenesis;GO:0016043 - cellular component organization;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0033554 - cellular response to stress;GO:0048878 - chemical homeostasis;GO:0006935 - chemotaxis;GO:0050817 - coagulation;GO:0032502 - developmental process;GO:0007507 - heart development;GO:0035556 - intracellular signal transduction;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0000165 - MAPK cascade;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0016310 - phosphorylation;GO:0030168 - platelet activation;GO:0042127 - regulation of cell proliferation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0042325 - regulation of phosphorylation;GO:0072001 - renal system development;GO:0000003 - reproduction;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0048511 - rhythmic process;GO:0007165 - signal transduction;GO:0042060 - wound healing	GO:0043167 - ion binding;GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0005737 - cytoplasm;GO:0005887 - integral component of plasma membrane;GO:0031226 - intrinsic component of plasma membrane;GO:0016020 - membrane;GO:0005634 - nucleus;GO:0005886 - plasma membrane;GO:0043234 - protein complex

TNFRSF21	O75509	ENSG00000146072	TNFRSF21	O75509	tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 21	This gene encodes a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. The encoded protein activates nuclear factor kappa-B and mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (also called c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1), and induces cell apoptosis. Through its death domain, the encoded receptor interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated death domain (TRADD) protein, which is known to mediate signal transduction of tumor necrosis factor receptors. Knockout studies in mice suggest that this gene plays a role in T-helper cell activation, and may be involved in inflammation and immune regulation. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]	183	Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 21	TNFRSF21	Promotes apoptosis, possibly via a pathway that involves the activation of NF-kappa-B. Can also promote apoptosis mediated by BAX and by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm. Plays a role in neuronal apoptosis, including apoptosis in response to amyloid peptides derived from APP, and is required for both normal cell body death and axonal pruning. Trophic-factor deprivation triggers the cleavage of surface APP by beta-secretase to release sAPP-beta which is further cleaved to release an N-terminal fragment of APP (N-APP). N-APP binds TNFRSF21; this triggers caspase activation and degeneration of both neuronal cell bodies (via caspase-3) and axons (via caspase-6). Negatively regulates oligodendrocyte survival, maturation and myelination.

Chemokines form a superfamily of secreted proteins involved in immunoregulatory and inflammatory processes. The superfamily is divided into four subfamilies based on the arrangement of the N-terminal cysteine residues of the mature peptide. This chemokine, a member of the CC subfamily, functions as a chemoattractant for blood monocytes, memory T helper cells and eosinophils. It causes the release of histamine from basophils and activates eosinophils. This cytokine is one of the major HIV-suppressive factors produced by CD8+ cells. It functions as one of the natural ligands for the chemokine receptor chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5), and it suppresses in vitro replication of the R5 strains of HIV-1, which use CCR5 as a coreceptor. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants that encode different isoforms.

One of the major HIV-suppressive factors produced by CD8+ T-cells. Recombinant RANTES protein induces a dose-dependent inhibition of different strains of HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). The processed form RANTES(3-68) acts as a natural chemotaxis inhibitor and is a more potent inhibitor of HIV-1-infection. The second processed form RANTES(4-68) exhibits reduced chemotactic and HIV-suppressive activity compared with RANTES(1-68) and RANTES(3-68) and is generated by an unidentified enzyme associated with monocytes and neutrophils (PubMed:16791620, PubMed:1380064, PubMed:8525373, PubMed:9516414, PubMed:15923218). May also be an agonist of the G protein-coupled receptor GPR75, stimulating inositol trisphosphate production and calcium mobilization through its activation. Together with GPR75, may play a role in neuron survival through activation of a downstream signaling pathway involving the PI3, Akt and MAP kinases. By activating GPR75 may also play a role in insulin secretion by islet cells (PubMed:23979485).	9990	Secreted	Biological process - Chemotaxis,Biological process - Inflammatory response,Cellular component - Secreted,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Domain - Signal,Molecular function - Cytokine,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Oxidation,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Direct protein sequencing,Technical term - Reference proteome	CardioMet	Cancer-related genes, Plasma proteins, Predicted membrane proteins, Predicted secreted proteins	Expressed in all		signaling molecule	Signal Transduction	GO:0006953 - acute-phase response;GO:0001525 - angiogenesis;GO:0006915 - apoptotic process;GO:0022610 - biological adhesion;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0009058 - biosynthetic process;GO:0048514 - blood vessel morphogenesis;GO:0001775 - cell activation;GO:0007155 - cell adhesion;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0008219 - cell death;GO:0030154 - cell differentiation;GO:0016477 - cell migration;GO:0048870 - cell motility;GO:0008283 - cell proliferation;GO:0007166 - cell surface receptor signaling pathway;GO:0044085 - cellular component biogenesis;GO:0016043 - cellular component organization;GO:0051641 - cellular localization;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0071345 - cellular response to cytokine stimulus;GO:0033554 - cellular response to stress;GO:0048878 - chemical homeostasis;GO:0006935 - chemotaxis;GO:0019221 - cytokine-mediated signaling pathway;GO:0032502 - developmental process;GO:0046879 - hormone secretion;GO:0006955 - immune response;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0006954 - inflammatory response;GO:0045087 - innate immune response;GO:0035556 - intracellular signal transduction;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0046649 - lymphocyte activation;GO:0000165 - MAPK cascade;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0030001 - metal ion transport;GO:0022008 - neurogenesis;GO:0006518 - peptide metabolic process;GO:0016310 - phosphorylation;GO:0030155 - regulation of cell adhesion;GO:0042127 - regulation of cell proliferation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0010468 - regulation of gene expression;GO:0050776 - regulation of immune response;GO:0045088 - regulation of innate immune response;GO:0042325 - regulation of phosphorylation;GO:0042493 - response to drug;GO:0034341 - response to interferon-gamma;GO:0055094 - response to lipoprotein particle;GO:0043434 - response to peptide hormone;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0046903 - secretion;GO:0007165 - signal transduction;GO:0042110 - T cell activation;GO:0042098 - T cell proliferation;GO:0006810 - transport	GO:0005125 - cytokine activity;GO:0016787 - hydrolase activity;GO:0043167 - ion binding;GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0005737 - cytoplasm;GO:0005576 - extracellular region;GO:0005615 - extracellular space

NOTCH1	P46531	ENSG00000148400	NOTCH1	P46531	notch 1	This gene encodes a member of the Notch family. Members of this Type 1 transmembrane protein family share structural characteristics including an extracellular domain consisting of multiple epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats, and an intracellular domain consisting of multiple, different domain types. Notch family members play a role in a variety of developmental processes by controlling cell fate decisions. The Notch signaling network is an evolutionarily conserved intercellular signaling pathway which regulates interactions between physically adjacent cells. In Drosophilia, notch interaction with its cell-bound ligands (delta, serrate) establishes an intercellular signaling pathway that plays a key role in development. Homologues of the notch-ligands have also been identified in human, but precise interactions between these ligands and the human notch homologues remain to be determined. This protein is cleaved in the trans-Golgi network, and presented on the cell surface as a heterodimer. This protein functions as a receptor for membrane bound ligands, and may play multiple roles during development.

CST3	P01034	ENSG00000101439	CST3	P01034,P01034,P01034	cystatin C	The cystatin superfamily encompasses proteins that contain multiple cystatin-like sequences. Some of the members are active cysteine protease inhibitors, while others have lost or perhaps never acquired this inhibitory activity. There are three inhibitory families in the superfamily, including the type 1 cystatins (stefins), type 2 cystatins and the kininogens. The type 2 cystatin proteins are a class of cysteine proteinase inhibitors found in a variety of human fluids and secretions, where they appear to provide protective functions. The cystatin locus on chromosome 20 contains the majority of the type 2 cystatin genes and pseudogenes. This gene is located in the cystatin locus and encodes the most abundant extracellular inhibitor of cysteine proteases, which is found in high concentrations in biological fluids and is expressed in virtually all organs of the body. A mutation in this gene has been associated with amyloid angiopathy. Expression of this protein in vascular wall smooth muscle cells is severely reduced in both atherosclerotic and aneurysmal aortic lesions, establishing its role in vascular disease. In addition, this protein has been shown to have an antimicrobial function, inhibiting the replication of herpes simplex virus. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding a single protein.

Various mutations in the MET gene are associated with papillary renal carcinoma. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]	127	Hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGF receptor)	MET	Receptor tyrosine kinase that transduces signals from the extracellular matrix into the cytoplasm by binding to hepatocyte growth factor/HGF ligand. Regulates many physiological processes including proliferation, scattering, morphogenesis and survival. Ligand binding at the cell surface induces autophosphorylation of MET on its intracellular domain that provides docking sites for downstream signaling molecules. Following activation by ligand, interacts with the PI3-kinase subunit PIK3R1, PLCG1, SRC, GRB2, STAT3 or the adapter GAB1. Recruitment of these downstream effectors by MET leads to the activation of several signaling cascades including the RAS-ERK, PI3 kinase-AKT, or PLCgamma-PKC. The RAS-ERK activation is associated with the morphogenetic effects while PI3K/AKT coordinates prosurvival effects. During embryonic development, MET signaling plays a role in gastrulation, development and migration of muscles and neuronal precursors, angiogenesis and kidney formation. In adults, participates in wound healing as well as organ regeneration and tissue remodeling. Promotes also differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic cells. May regulate cortical bone osteogenesis (By similarity).,Acts as a receptor for Listeria internalin inlB, mediating entry of the pathogen into cells.	155541	Membrane,Secreted	Cellular component - Membrane,Cellular component - Secreted,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Coding sequence diversity - Chromosomal rearrangement,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Disease - Deafness,Disease - Disease mutation,Disease - Proto-oncogene,Disease - Non-syndromic deafness,Domain - Repeat,Domain - Signal,Domain - Transmembrane,Domain - Transmembrane helix,Ligand - ATP-binding,Ligand - Nucleotide-binding,Molecular function - Kinase,Molecular function - Receptor,Molecular function - Transferase,Molecular function - Tyrosine-protein kinase,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Phosphoprotein,PTM - Ubl conjugation,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Reference proteome	CardioMet	Cancer-related genes, Disease related genes, Enzymes, FDA approved drug targets, Plasma proteins, Predicted intracellular proteins, Predicted membrane proteins, Predicted secreted proteins, RAS pathway related proteins	Expressed in all			Developmental Biology	GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0009058 - biosynthetic process;GO:0009056 - catabolic process;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0008219 - cell death;GO:0030154 - cell differentiation;GO:0016477 - cell migration;GO:0048870 - cell motility;GO:0008283 - cell proliferation;GO:0007166 - cell surface receptor signaling pathway;GO:0016043 - cellular component organization;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0033554 - cellular response to stress;GO:0006935 - chemotaxis;GO:0032502 - developmental process;GO:0043542 - endothelial cell migration;GO:0030855 - epithelial cell differentiation;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0010468 - regulation of gene expression;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0007165 - signal transduction	GO:0043167 - ion binding;GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0009925 - basal plasma membrane;GO:0009986 - cell surface;GO:0005576 - extracellular region;GO:0016021 - integral component of membrane;GO:0005887 - integral component of plasma membrane;GO:0005886 - plasma membrane

ANGPTL3	Q9Y5C1	ENSG00000132855	ANGPTL3	Q9Y5C1	angiopoietin-like 3	This gene encodes a member of a family of secreted proteins that function in angiogenesis. The encoded protein, which is expressed predominantly in the liver, is further processed into an N-terminal coiled-coil domain-containing chain and a C-terminal fibrinogen chain. The N-terminal chain is important for lipid metabolism, while the C-terminal chain may be involved in angiogenesis. Mutations in this gene cause familial hypobetalipoproteinemia type 2. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2015]	138	Angiopoietin-related protein 3	ANGPTL3	Acts in part as a hepatokine that is involved in regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism (PubMed:11788823, PubMed:12909640, PubMed:23661675, PubMed:25495645). Proposed to play a role in the trafficking of energy substrates to either storage or oxidative tissues in response to food intake (By similarity). Has a stimulatory effect on plasma triglycerides (TG), which is achieved by suppressing plasma TG clearance via inhibition of LPL activity. The inhibition of LPL activity appears to be an indirect mechanism involving recruitment of proprotein convertases PCSK6 and FURIN to LPL leading to cleavage and dissociation of LPL from the cell surface; the function does not require ANGPTL3 proteolytic cleavage but seems to be mediated by the N-terminal domain, and is not inhibited by GPIHBP1 (PubMed:12097324, PubMed:19318355, PubMed:20581395). Can inhibit endothelial lipase, causing increased plasma levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and phospholipids (PubMed:17110602, PubMed:19028676). Can bind to adipocytes to activate lipolysis, releasing free fatty acids and glycerol (PubMed:12565906). Suppresses LPL specifically in oxidative tissues which is required to route very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG to white adipose tissue (WAT) for storage in response to food; the function may involve cooperation with circulating, liver-derived ANGPTL8 and ANGPTL4 expression in WAT (By similarity). Contributes to lower plasma levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol by a mechanism that is independent of the canonical pathway implicating APOE and LDLR. May stimulate hypothalamic LPL activity (By similarity).,ANGPTL3(17-221): In vitro inhibits LPL activity; not effective on GPIHBP1-stabilized LPL.,Involved in angiogenesis. Binds to endothelial cells via integrin alpha-V/beta-3 (ITGAV:ITGB3), activates FAK, MAPK and Akt signaling pathways and induces cell adhesion and cell migration (PubMed:11877390).

This factor circulates in the blood in a zymogen form, and is converted to an active form by either factor IXa, factor Xa, factor XIIa, or thrombin by minor proteolysis. Upon activation of the factor VII, a heavy chain containing a catalytic domain and a light chain containing 2 EGF-like domains are generated, and two chains are held together by a disulfide bond. In the presence of factor III and calcium ions, the activated factor then further activates the coagulation cascade by converting factor IX to factor IXa and/or factor X to factor Xa. Defects in this gene can cause coagulopathy. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms that may undergo similar proteolytic processing to generate mature polypeptides.

Members of this family transport small hydrophobic molecules such as lipids, steroid hormones and retinoids. The protein encoded by this gene is a neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and plays a role in innate immunity by limiting bacterial growth as a result of sequestering iron-containing siderophores. The presence of this protein in blood and urine is an early biomarker of acute kidney injury. This protein is thought to be be involved in multiple cellular processes, including maintenance of skin homeostasis, and suppression of invasiveness and metastasis. Mice lacking this gene are more susceptible to bacterial infection than wild type mice. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015]	185	Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)	LCN2	Iron-trafficking protein involved in multiple processes such as apoptosis, innate immunity and renal development. Binds iron through association with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHBA), a siderophore that shares structural similarities with bacterial enterobactin, and delivers or removes iron from the cell, depending on the context. Iron-bound form (holo-24p3) is internalized following binding to the SLC22A17 (24p3R) receptor, leading to release of iron and subsequent increase of intracellular iron concentration. In contrast, association of the iron-free form (apo-24p3) with the SLC22A17 (24p3R) receptor is followed by association with an intracellular siderophore, iron chelation and iron transfer to the extracellular medium, thereby reducing intracellular iron concentration. Involved in apoptosis due to interleukin-3 (IL3) deprivation: iron-loaded form increases intracellular iron concentration without promoting apoptosis, while iron-free form decreases intracellular iron levels, inducing expression of the proapoptotic protein BCL2L11/BIM, resulting in apoptosis. Involved in innate immunity, possibly by sequestrating iron, leading to limit bacterial growth.	22588	Secreted	Biological process - Apoptosis,Biological process - Immunity,Biological process - Innate immunity,Biological process - Ion transport,Biological process - Iron transport,Biological process - Transport,Cellular component - Secreted,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Domain - Signal,Ligand - Iron,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Pyrrolidone carboxylic acid,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Direct protein sequencing,Technical term - Reference proteome	CardioMet	Candidate cardiovascular disease genes, Plasma proteins, Predicted secreted proteins	Tissue enhanced	bone marrow: 1466.7;gallbladder: 2215.8	transfer/carrier protein; isomerase	Transmembrane transport of small molecules	GO:0006915 - apoptotic process;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0008219 - cell death;GO:0051641 - cellular localization;GO:0048878 - chemical homeostasis;GO:0006955 - immune response;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0045087 - innate immune response;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0006810 - transport	GO:0043167 - ion binding;GO:0005215 - transporter activity	GO:0005623 - cell;GO:0070062 - extracellular exosome;GO:0005576 - extracellular region;GO:0005615 - extracellular space

In response to KITLG/SCF binding, KIT can activate several signaling pathways. Phosphorylates PIK3R1, PLCG1, SH2B2/APS and CBL. Activates the AKT1 signaling pathway by phosphorylation of PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Activated KIT also transmits signals via GRB2 and activation of RAS, RAF1 and the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and/or MAPK3/ERK1. Promotes activation of STAT family members STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A and STAT5B. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. KIT signaling is modulated by protein phosphatases, and by rapid internalization and degradation of the receptor. Activated KIT promotes phosphorylation of the protein phosphatases PTPN6/SHP-1 and PTPRU, and of the transcription factors STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A and STAT5B. Promotes phosphorylation of PIK3R1, CBL, CRK (isoform Crk-II), LYN, MAPK1/ERK2 and/or MAPK3/ERK1, PLCG1, SRC and SHC1.	109865	Cell membrane,Cell membrane,Cytoplasm	Cellular component - Membrane,Cellular component - Cytoplasm,Cellular component - Cell membrane,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Disease - Disease mutation,Disease - Proto-oncogene,Domain - Immunoglobulin domain,Domain - Repeat,Domain - Signal,Domain - Transmembrane,Domain - Transmembrane helix,Ligand - ATP-binding,Ligand - Magnesium,Ligand - Metal-binding,Ligand - Nucleotide-binding,Molecular function - Kinase,Molecular function - Receptor,Molecular function - Transferase,Molecular function - Tyrosine-protein kinase,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Phosphoprotein,PTM - Ubl conjugation,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Direct protein sequencing,Technical term - Reference proteome	CardioMet	Cancer-related genes, CD markers, Disease related genes, Enzymes, FDA approved drug targets, Plasma proteins, Predicted membrane proteins, RAS pathway related proteins	Mixed			Developmental Biology; Immune System; Signal Transduction	GO:0022610 - biological adhesion;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0009058 - biosynthetic process;GO:0001775 - cell activation;GO:0002263 - cell activation involved in immune response;GO:0007155 - cell adhesion;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0008219 - cell death;GO:0030154 - cell differentiation;GO:0051301 - cell division;GO:0016477 - cell migration;GO:0048870 - cell motility;GO:0008283 - cell proliferation;GO:0007166 - cell surface receptor signaling pathway;GO:0044085 - cellular component biogenesis;GO:0016043 - cellular component organization;GO:0051641 - cellular localization;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0071345 - cellular response to cytokine stimulus;GO:0006935 - chemotaxis;GO:0050890 - cognition;GO:0019221 - cytokine-mediated signaling pathway;GO:0002371 - dendritic cell cytokine production;GO:0032502 - developmental process;GO:0030855 - epithelial cell differentiation;GO:0006955 - immune response;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0006954 - inflammatory response;GO:0035556 - intracellular signal transduction;GO:0046907 - intracellular transport;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0046649 - lymphocyte activation;GO:0000165 - MAPK cascade;GO:0045576 - mast cell activation;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0022008 - neurogenesis;GO:0007219 - Notch signaling pathway;GO:0016310 - phosphorylation;GO:0042127 - regulation of cell proliferation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0010468 - regulation of gene expression;GO:0050776 - regulation of immune response;GO:0042325 - regulation of phosphorylation;GO:0000003 - reproduction;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0048511 - rhythmic process;GO:0046903 - secretion;GO:0007165 - signal transduction;GO:0042110 - T cell activation;GO:0006810 - transport	GO:0043167 - ion binding;GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0001669 - acrosomal vesicle;GO:0005911 - cell-cell junction;GO:0009898 - cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane;GO:0009897 - external side of plasma membrane;GO:0005615 - extracellular space;GO:0016021 - integral component of membrane;GO:0042629 - mast cell granule;GO:0005886 - plasma membrane

Ghrelin is a powerful appetite stimulant and plays an important role in energy homeostasis. Its secretion is initiated when the stomach is empty, whereupon it binds to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor in the hypothalamus which results in the secretion of growth hormone (somatotropin). Ghrelin is thought to regulate multiple activities, including hunger, reward perception via the mesolimbic pathway, gastric acid secretion, gastrointestinal motility, and pancreatic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. It was initially proposed that obestatin plays an opposing role to ghrelin by promoting satiety and thus decreasing food intake, but this action is still debated. Recent reports suggest multiple metabolic roles for obestatin, including regulating adipocyte function and glucose metabolism. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. In addition, antisense transcripts for this gene have been identified and may potentially regulate ghrelin-obestatin preproprotein expression.

Members of this family are adhesion receptors that function in signaling from the extracellular matrix to the cell. Integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha chain and a beta chain. The encoded protein forms dimers with an alpha4 chain or an alphaE chain and plays a role in leukocyte adhesion. Dimerization with alpha4 forms a homing receptor for migration of lymphocytes to the intestinal mucosa and Peyer's patches. Dimerization with alphaE permits binding to the ligand epithelial cadherin, a calcium-dependent adhesion molecule. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Additional alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but their full-length nature is not known. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]	144	Integrin beta-7	ITGB7	Integrin alpha-4/beta-7 (Peyer patches-specific homing receptor LPAM-1) is an adhesion molecule that mediates lymphocyte migration and homing to gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Integrin alpha-4/beta-7 interacts with the cell surface adhesion molecules MADCAM1 which is normally expressed by the vascular endothelium of the gastrointestinal tract. Interacts also with VCAM1 and fibronectin, an extracellular matrix component. It recognizes one or more domains within the alternatively spliced CS-1 region of fibronectin. Interactions involves the tripeptide L-D-T in MADCAM1, and L-D-V in fibronectin. Binds to HIV-1 gp120, thereby allowing the virus to enter GALT, which is thought to be the major trigger of AIDS disease. Interaction would involve a tripeptide L-D-I in HIV-1 gp120. Integrin alpha-E/beta-7 (HML-1) is a receptor for E-cadherin.	86903	Membrane	Biological process - Cell adhesion,Cellular component - Membrane,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Domain - Repeat,Domain - Signal,Domain - Transmembrane,Domain - Transmembrane helix,Ligand - Magnesium,Ligand - Metal-binding,Molecular function - Integrin,Molecular function - Receptor,Molecular function - Host cell receptor for virus entry,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Phosphoprotein,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Direct protein sequencing,Technical term - Reference proteome	Met 	Cancer-related genes, Plasma proteins, Predicted membrane proteins, Predicted secreted proteins	Mixed		cell adhesion molecule; extracellular matrix protein; receptor	Extracellular matrix organization; Immune System	GO:0022610 - biological adhesion;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0007155 - cell adhesion;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0030154 - cell differentiation;GO:0016477 - cell migration;GO:0048870 - cell motility;GO:0007166 - cell surface receptor signaling pathway;GO:0016043 - cellular component organization;GO:0051641 - cellular localization;GO:0032502 - developmental process;GO:0030198 - extracellular matrix organization;GO:0006955 - immune response;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0050776 - regulation of immune response;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0007165 - signal transduction	GO:0043167 - ion binding;GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0009986 - cell surface;GO:0070062 - extracellular exosome;GO:0034669 - integrin alpha4-beta7 complex;GO:0008305 - integrin complex;GO:0016020 - membrane;GO:0005886 - plasma membrane;GO:0043235 - receptor complex

[provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]	182	Large proline-rich protein BAG6	BAG6	Chaperone that plays a key role in various processes such as apoptosis, insertion of tail-anchored (TA) membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and regulation of chromatin. Key component of the BAG6/BAT3 complex, a cytosolic multiprotein complex involved in the post-translational delivery of tail-anchored (TA) membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. TA membrane proteins, also named type II transmembrane proteins, contain a single C-terminal transmembrane region. BAG6/BAT3 acts by facilitating TA membrane proteins capture by ASNA1/TRC40: it is recruited to ribosomes synthesizing membrane proteins, interacts with the transmembrane region of newly released TA proteins and transfers them to ASNA1/TRC40 for targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Moreover, it regulates the stability and the degradation of proteins by the proteasome. For instance, it is required for selective ubiquitin-mediated degradation of defective nascent chain polypeptides by the proteasome. In this context, may play a role in immuno-proteasomes to generate antigenic peptides via targeted degradation, thereby playing a role in antigen presentation in immune response. It is also involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of proteins of the secretory pathway that are mislocalized to the cytosol. Binds the mislocalized proteins, preventing their aggregation in the cytosol, and promotes their ubiquitination. Participates in endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis via its interaction with AIFM1/AIF by regulating AIFM1/AIF stability and preventing its degradation. Also required during spermatogenesis for synaptonemal complex assembly via its interaction with HSPA2, by inhibiting polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of HSPA2.,Involved in DNA damage-induced apoptosis: following DNA damage, accumulates in the nucleus and forms a complex with p300/EP300, enhancing p300/EP300-mediated p53/TP53 acetylation leading to increase p53/TP53 transcriptional activity. When nuclear, may also act as a component of some chromatin regulator complex that regulates histone 3 'Lys-4' dimethylation (H3K4me2).,Can be released from tumor and dendritic cells in membrane vesicles or exosomes, and engage NCR3 thereby promoting natural killer cells (NK) activation and cytotoxicity.	119409	Cytoplasm,Cytosol,Nucleus	Biological process - Apoptosis,Biological process - Differentiation,Biological process - Immunity,Biological process - Spermatogenesis,Biological process - Transport,Cellular component - Nucleus,Cellular component - Cytoplasm,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Domain - Repeat,Molecular function - Chaperone,Molecular function - Chromatin regulator,PTM - Acetylation,PTM - Phosphoprotein,PTM - Ubl conjugation,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Reference proteome	Met 	Predicted intracellular proteins	Expressed in all		enzyme modulator		GO:0006915 - apoptotic process;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0009056 - catabolic process;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0007049 - cell cycle;GO:0008219 - cell death;GO:0030154 - cell differentiation;GO:0008283 - cell proliferation;GO:0044085 - cellular component biogenesis;GO:0016043 - cellular component organization;GO:0051641 - cellular localization;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0033554 - cellular response to stress;GO:0032502 - developmental process;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0035556 - intracellular signal transduction;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0006508 - proteolysis;GO:0042127 - regulation of cell proliferation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0072001 - renal system development;GO:0000003 - reproduction;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0007165 - signal transduction;GO:0006810 - transport	GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0071818 - BAT3 complex;GO:0005737 - cytoplasm;GO:0005829 - cytosol;GO:0043231 - intracellular membrane-bounded organelle;GO:0016020 - membrane;GO:0005654 - nucleoplasm;GO:0005634 - nucleus

One of these, glucagon, is a pancreatic hormone that counteracts the glucose-lowering action of insulin by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Glucagon is a ligand for a specific G-protein linked receptor whose signalling pathway controls cell proliferation. Two of the other peptides are secreted from gut endocrine cells and promote nutrient absorption through distinct mechanisms. Finally, the fourth peptide is similar to glicentin, an active enteroglucagon. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]	101	Glucagon	GCG	Glucagon plays a key role in glucose metabolism and homeostasis. Regulates blood glucose by increasing gluconeogenesis and decreasing glycolysis. A counterregulatory hormone of insulin, raises plasma glucose levels in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Plays an important role in initiating and maintaining hyperglycemic conditions in diabetes.,GLP-1 is a potent stimulator of glucose-dependent insulin release. Play important roles on gastric motility and the suppression of plasma glucagon levels. May be involved in the suppression of satiety and stimulation of glucose disposal in peripheral tissues, independent of the actions of insulin. Have growth-promoting activities on intestinal epithelium. May also regulate the hypothalamic pituitary axis (HPA) via effects on LH, TSH, CRH, oxytocin, and vasopressin secretion. Increases islet mass through stimulation of islet neogenesis and pancreatic beta cell proliferation. Inhibits beta cell apoptosis.,GLP-2 stimulates intestinal growth and up-regulates villus height in the small intestine, concomitant with increased crypt cell proliferation and decreased enterocyte apoptosis. The gastrointestinal tract, from the stomach to the colon is the principal target for GLP-2 action. Plays a key role in nutrient homeostasis, enhancing nutrient assimilation through enhanced gastrointestinal function, as well as increasing nutrient disposal. Stimulates intestinal glucose transport and decreases mucosal permeability.,Oxyntomodulin significantly reduces food intake. Inhibits gastric emptying in humans. Suppression of gastric emptying may lead to increased gastric distension, which may contribute to satiety by causing a sensation of fullness.,Glicentin may modulate gastric acid secretion and the gastro-pyloro-duodenal activity. May play an important role in intestinal mucosal growth in the early period of life.	20909	Secreted	Cellular component - Secreted,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Domain - Signal,Molecular function - Hormone,PTM - Amidation,PTM - Cleavage on pair of basic residues,PTM - Phosphoprotein,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Pharmaceutical,Technical term - Direct protein sequencing,Technical term - Reference proteome	Cell Reg	Predicted secreted proteins	Tissue enhanced	pancreas: 369.3	signaling molecule	Metabolism; Metabolism of proteins; Signal Transduction	GO:0006915 - apoptotic process;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0009058 - biosynthetic process;GO:0005975 - carbohydrate metabolic process;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0008219 - cell death;GO:0008283 - cell proliferation;GO:0016043 - cellular component organization;GO:0051641 - cellular localization;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0048878 - chemical homeostasis;GO:0046879 - hormone secretion;GO:0035556 - intracellular signal transduction;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0000165 - MAPK cascade;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0030001 - metal ion transport;GO:0016310 - phosphorylation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0010468 - regulation of gene expression;GO:0042325 - regulation of phosphorylation;GO:0043434 - response to peptide hormone;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0046903 - secretion;GO:0007165 - signal transduction;GO:0006810 - transport	GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0005788 - endoplasmic reticulum lumen;GO:0005576 - extracellular region;GO:0005615 - extracellular space;GO:0005886 - plasma membrane;GO:0034774 - secretory granule lumen

The encoded protein responds to diverse cellular stresses to regulate expression of target genes, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, or changes in metabolism. Mutations in this gene are associated with a variety of human cancers, including hereditary cancers such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Alternative splicing of this gene and the use of alternate promoters result in multiple transcript variants and isoforms. Additional isoforms have also been shown to result from the use of alternate translation initiation codons (PMIDs: 12032546, 20937277). [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2013]	152	Cellular tumor antigen p53	TP53	Acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological circumstances and cell type. Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA-Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492).	43653	Cytoplasm,Nucleus,Nucleus,PML body,Endoplasmic reticulum,Mitochondrion matrix,Nucleus,Cytoplasm,Nucleus,Cytoplasm,Nucleus,Cytoplasm,Nucleus,Cytoplasm,Nucleus,Cytoplasm,Nucleus,Cytoplasm,Cytoplasm	Biological process - Apoptosis,Biological process - Biological rhythms,Biological process - Cell cycle,Biological process - Transcription,Biological process - Transcription regulation,Biological process - Host-virus interaction,Biological process - Necrosis,Cellular component - Endoplasmic reticulum,Cellular component - Mitochondrion,Cellular component - Nucleus,Cellular component - Cytoplasm,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative promoter usage,Disease - Tumor suppressor,Disease - Disease mutation,Disease - Li-Fraumeni syndrome,Ligand - DNA-binding,Ligand - Metal-binding,Ligand - Zinc,Molecular function - Activator,Molecular function - Repressor,PTM - Acetylation,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Methylation,PTM - Phosphoprotein,PTM - Ubl conjugation,PTM - Isopeptide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Reference proteome	Cell Reg	Cancer-related genes, Disease related genes, Plasma proteins, Potential drug targets, Predicted intracellular proteins, Transcription factors, Transporters	Expressed in all		transcription factor	Cell Cycle; Cellular responses to stress; DNA Repair; Gene Expression; Hemostasis; Programmed Cell Death; Signal Transduction	GO:0006915 - apoptotic process;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0009058 - biosynthetic process;GO:0009056 - catabolic process;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0007049 - cell cycle;GO:0008219 - cell death;GO:0030154 - cell differentiation;GO:0016049 - cell growth;GO:0008283 - cell proliferation;GO:0044085 - cellular component biogenesis;GO:0016043 - cellular component organization;GO:0051641 - cellular localization;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0071456 - cellular response to hypoxia;GO:0033554 - cellular response to stress;GO:0032502 - developmental process;GO:0006281 - DNA repair;GO:0040007 - growth;GO:0035556 - intracellular signal transduction;GO:0046907 - intracellular transport;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0016310 - phosphorylation;GO:0006508 - proteolysis;GO:0042127 - regulation of cell proliferation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0010468 - regulation of gene expression;GO:0042325 - regulation of phosphorylation;GO:0042493 - response to drug;GO:0001666 - response to hypoxia;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0048511 - rhythmic process;GO:0007165 - signal transduction;GO:0006810 - transport	GO:0043167 - ion binding;GO:0003676 - nucleic acid binding;GO:0001071 - nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity;GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0005737 - cytoplasm;GO:0005829 - cytosol;GO:0005783 - endoplasmic reticulum;GO:0005759 - mitochondrial matrix;GO:0005739 - mitochondrion;GO:0000790 - nuclear chromatin;GO:0016363 - nuclear matrix;GO:0005730 - nucleolus;GO:0005654 - nucleoplasm;GO:0005634 - nucleus;GO:0016605 - PML body;GO:0043234 - protein complex;GO:0005657 - replication fork

These proteins catalyze the addition of sulfate groups at the 3-OH position of glucosamine in heparan sulfate. The substrate specificity of individual members of the family is based on prior modification of the heparan sulfate chain, thus allowing different members of the family to generate binding sites for different proteins on the same heparan sulfate chain. Following treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, expression of this gene is activated in a pancreatic cell line. The increased expression results in promotion of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In addition, the modification catalyzed by this protein allows herpes simplex virus membrane fusion and penetration. A very closely related homolog with an almost identical sulfotransferase domain maps less than 1 Mb away. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

CTSF	Q9UBX1	ENSG00000174080	CTSF	H0YD65,E9PSC2,Q9UBX1	cathepsin F	Cathepsins are papain family cysteine proteinases that represent a major component of the lysosomal proteolytic system. Cathepsins generally contain a signal sequence, followed by a propeptide and then a catalytically active mature region. The very long (251 amino acid residues) proregion of the cathepsin F precursor contains a C-terminal domain similar to the pro-segment of cathepsin L-like enzymes, a 50-residue flexible linker peptide, and an N-terminal domain predicted to adopt a cystatin-like fold. The cathepsin F proregion is unique within the papain family cysteine proteases in that it contains this additional N-terminal segment predicted to share structural similarities with cysteine protease inhibitors of the cystatin superfamily. This cystatin-like domain contains some of the elements known to be important for inhibitory activity. CTSF encodes a predicted protein of 484 amino acids which contains a 19 residue signal peptide. Cathepsin F contains five potential N-glycosylation sites, and it may be targeted to the endosomal/lysosomal compartment via the mannose 6-phosphate receptor pathway. The cathepsin F gene is ubiquitously expressed, and it maps to chromosome 11q13, close to the gene encoding cathepsin W.

Involved in cell mobility and transcription regulation through protein-protein interactions. Can promote transcription activation through binding to APBB1-KAT5 and inhibits Notch signaling through interaction with Numb. Couples to apoptosis-inducing pathways such as those mediated by G(O) and JIP. Inhibits G(o) alpha ATPase activity (By similarity). Acts as a kinesin I membrane receptor, mediating the axonal transport of beta-secretase and presenilin 1. Involved in copper homeostasis/oxidative stress through copper ion reduction. In vitro, copper-metallated APP induces neuronal death directly or is potentiated through Cu(2+)-mediated low-density lipoprotein oxidation. Can regulate neurite outgrowth through binding to components of the extracellular matrix such as heparin and collagen I and IV. The splice isoforms that contain the BPTI domain possess protease inhibitor activity. Induces a AGER-dependent pathway that involves activation of p38 MAPK, resulting in internalization of amyloid-beta peptide and leading to mitochondrial dysfunction in cultured cortical neurons.

HAVCR2	Q8TDQ0	ENSG00000135077	HAVCR2	Q8TDQ0,E5RHN3,E5RFR4	hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2	The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily, and TIM family of proteins. CD4-positive T helper lymphocytes can be divided into types 1 (Th1) and 2 (Th2) on the basis of their cytokine secretion patterns. Th1 cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity to intracellular pathogens and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, whereas, Th2 cells are involved in the control of extracellular helminthic infections and the promotion of atopic and allergic diseases. This protein is a Th1-specific cell surface protein that regulates macrophage activation, and inhibits Th1-mediated auto- and alloimmune responses, and promotes immunological tolerance. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2011]	112	Hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2 (HAVcr-2)	HAVCR2	Cell surface receptor implicated in modulating innate and adaptive immune responses. Generally accepted to have an inhibiting function. Reports on stimulating functions suggest that the activity may be influenced by the cellular context and/or the respective ligand (PubMed:24825777). Regulates macrophage activation (PubMed:11823861). Inhibits T-helper type 1 lymphocyte (Th1)-mediated auto- and alloimmune responses and promotes immunological tolerance (PubMed:14556005). In CD8+ cells attenuates TCR-induced signaling, specifically by blocking NF-kappaB and NFAT promoter activities resulting in the loss of IL-2 secretion. The function may implicate its association with LCK proposed to impair phosphorylation of TCR subunits, and/or LGALS9-dependent recruitment of PTPRC to the immunological synapse (PubMed:24337741, PubMed:26492563). In contrast, shown to activate TCR-induced signaling in T-cells probably implicating ZAP70, LCP2, LCK and FYN (By similarity). Expressed on Treg cells can inhibit Th17 cell responses (PubMed:24838857). Receptor for LGALS9 (PubMed:16286920, PubMed:24337741). Binding to LGALS9 is believed to result in suppression of T-cell responses; the resulting apoptosis of antigen-specific cells may implicate HAVCR2 phosphorylation and disruption of its association with BAG6. Binding to LGALS9 is proposed to be involved in innate immune response to intracellular pathogens. Expressed on Th1 cells interacts with LGALS9 expressed on Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected macrophages to stimulate antibactericidal activity including IL-1 beta secretion and to restrict intracellular bacterial growth (By similarity). However, the function as receptor for LGALS9 has been challenged (PubMed:23555261). Also reported to enhance CD8+ T-cell responses to an acute infection such as by Listeria monocytogenes (By similarity). Receptor for phosphatidylserine (PtSer); PtSer-binding is calcium-dependent. May recognize PtSer on apoptotic cells leading to their phagocytosis. Mediates the engulfment of apoptotic cells by dendritic cells. Expressed on T-cells, promotes conjugation but not engulfment of apoptotic cells. Expressed on dendritic cells (DCs) positively regulates innate immune response and in synergy with Toll-like receptors promotes secretion of TNF-alpha. In tumor-imfiltrating DCs suppresses nucleic acid-mediated innate immune repsonse by interaction with HMGB1 and interfering with nucleic acid-sensing and trafficking of nucleid acids to endosomes (By similarity). Expressed on natural killer (NK) cells acts as a coreceptor to enhance IFN-gamma production in response to LGALS9 (PubMed:22323453). In contrast, shown to suppress NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity (PubMed:22383801). Negatively regulates NK cell function in LPS-induced endotoxic shock (By similarity).	33394	Membrane,Cell junction	Biological process - Immunity,Biological process - Inflammatory response,Biological process - Innate immunity,Biological process - Adaptive immunity,Cellular component - Membrane,Cellular component - Cell junction,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Domain - Immunoglobulin domain,Domain - Signal,Domain - Transmembrane,Domain - Transmembrane helix,Ligand - Metal-binding,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Phosphoprotein,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Reference proteome	Dev	Predicted intracellular proteins, Predicted membrane proteins	Mixed		cell adhesion molecule; defense/immunity protein; receptor	Immune System	GO:0002250 - adaptive immune response;GO:0022610 - biological adhesion;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0009058 - biosynthetic process;GO:0001775 - cell activation;GO:0002263 - cell activation involved in immune response;GO:0007155 - cell adhesion;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0001906 - cell killing;GO:0008283 - cell proliferation;GO:0051641 - cellular localization;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0050663 - cytokine secretion;GO:0032502 - developmental process;GO:0006955 - immune response;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0006954 - inflammatory response;GO:0045087 - innate immune response;GO:0035556 - intracellular signal transduction;GO:0001909 - leukocyte mediated cytotoxicity;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0046649 - lymphocyte activation;GO:0002281 - macrophage activation involved in immune response;GO:0000165 - MAPK cascade;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0002228 - natural killer cell mediated immunity;GO:0016310 - phosphorylation;GO:0030155 - regulation of cell adhesion;GO:0042127 - regulation of cell proliferation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0010468 - regulation of gene expression;GO:0050776 - regulation of immune response;GO:0045088 - regulation of innate immune response;GO:0042325 - regulation of phosphorylation;GO:0000003 - reproduction;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0002347 - response to tumor cell;GO:0046903 - secretion;GO:0007165 - signal transduction;GO:0042110 - T cell activation;GO:0042098 - T cell proliferation;GO:0042088 - T-helper 1 type immune response;GO:0006810 - transport	GO:0043167 - ion binding	GO:0030054 - cell junction;GO:0009986 - cell surface;GO:0005769 - early endosome;GO:0070062 - extracellular exosome;GO:0001772 - immunological synapse;GO:0016021 - integral component of membrane

The encoded protein is induced by peroxisome proliferation activators and functions as a serum hormone that regulates glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity. This protein can also act as an apoptosis survival factor for vascular endothelial cells and can prevent metastasis by inhibiting vascular growth and tumor cell invasion. The C-terminal domain may be proteolytically-cleaved from the full-length secreted protein. Decreased expression of this gene has been associated with type 2 diabetes. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. This gene was previously referred to as ANGPTL2 but has been renamed ANGPTL4.

May act as a regulator of angiogenesis and modulate tumorigenesis. Inhibits proliferation, migration, and tubule formation of endothelial cells and reduces vascular leakage. May exert a protective function on endothelial cells through an endocrine action. It is directly involved in regulating glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity.

This gene is flanked on chromosome 5 by the genes for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and macrophage-colony stimulating factor receptor; all three genes may be implicated in the 5-q syndrome. A translocation between chromosomes 5 and 12, that fuses this gene to that of the translocation, ETV6, leukemia gene, results in chronic myeloproliferative disorder with eosinophilia.

Plays an essential role in blood vessel development by promoting proliferation, migration and recruitment of pericytes and smooth muscle cells to endothelial cells. Plays a role in the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells and the formation of neointima at vascular injury sites. Required for normal development of the cardiovascular system. Required for normal recruitment of pericytes (mesangial cells) in the kidney glomerulus, and for normal formation of a branched network of capillaries in kidney glomeruli. Promotes rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of membrane ruffles. Binding of its cognate ligands - homodimeric PDGFB, heterodimers formed by PDGFA and PDGFB or homodimeric PDGFD -leads to the activation of several signaling cascades; the response depends on the nature of the bound ligand and is modulated by the formation of heterodimers between PDGFRA and PDGFRB. Phosphorylates PLCG1, PIK3R1, PTPN11, RASA1/GAP, CBL, SHC1 and NCK1. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, mobilization of cytosolic Ca(2+) and the activation of protein kinase C. Phosphorylation of PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, leads to the activation of the AKT1 signaling pathway. Phosphorylation of SHC1, or of the C-terminus of PTPN11, creates a binding site for GRB2, resulting in the activation of HRAS, RAF1 and down-stream MAP kinases, including MAPK1/ERK2 and/or MAPK3/ERK1. Promotes phosphorylation and activation of SRC family kinases. Promotes phosphorylation of PDCD6IP/ALIX and STAM. Receptor signaling is down-regulated by protein phosphatases that dephosphorylate the receptor and its down-stream effectors, and by rapid internalization of the activated receptor.	123968	Cell membrane,Cytoplasmic vesicle,Lysosome lumen	Biological process - Chemotaxis,Cellular component - Lysosome,Cellular component - Membrane,Cellular component - Cytoplasmic vesicle,Cellular component - Cell membrane,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Coding sequence diversity - Chromosomal rearrangement,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Disease - Disease mutation,Disease - Proto-oncogene,Domain - Immunoglobulin domain,Domain - Repeat,Domain - Signal,Domain - Transmembrane,Domain - Transmembrane helix,Ligand - ATP-binding,Ligand - Nucleotide-binding,Molecular function - Developmental protein,Molecular function - Kinase,Molecular function - Receptor,Molecular function - Transferase,Molecular function - Tyrosine-protein kinase,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Phosphoprotein,PTM - Ubl conjugation,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Direct protein sequencing,Technical term - Reference proteome	Dev	Cancer-related genes, CD markers, Disease related genes, Enzymes, FDA approved drug targets, Plasma proteins, Predicted intracellular proteins, Predicted membrane proteins, Predicted secreted proteins, RAS pathway related proteins	Mixed			Developmental Biology; Immune System; Signal Transduction	GO:0001525 - angiogenesis;GO:0006915 - apoptotic process;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0009058 - biosynthetic process;GO:0048514 - blood vessel morphogenesis;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0007049 - cell cycle;GO:0008219 - cell death;GO:0030154 - cell differentiation;GO:0051301 - cell division;GO:0016477 - cell migration;GO:0048870 - cell motility;GO:0008283 - cell proliferation;GO:0007166 - cell surface receptor signaling pathway;GO:0044085 - cellular component biogenesis;GO:0016043 - cellular component organization;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0006935 - chemotaxis;GO:0032502 - developmental process;GO:0007507 - heart development;GO:0035556 - intracellular signal transduction;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0000165 - MAPK cascade;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0030001 - metal ion transport;GO:0016310 - phosphorylation;GO:0042127 - regulation of cell proliferation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0042325 - regulation of phosphorylation;GO:0072001 - renal system development;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0007165 - signal transduction;GO:0006810 - transport;GO:0042060 - wound healing	GO:0043167 - ion binding;GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0016324 - apical plasma membrane;GO:0005737 - cytoplasm;GO:0016023 - cytoplasmic, membrane-bounded vesicle;GO:0070062 - extracellular exosome;GO:0005925 - focal adhesion;GO:0016021 - integral component of membrane;GO:0031226 - intrinsic component of plasma membrane;GO:0043202 - lysosomal lumen;GO:0016020 - membrane;GO:0005634 - nucleus;GO:0005886 - plasma membrane

SHP-1-mediated dephosphorylation of protein tyrosine residues is central to the regulation of several cell signaling pathways. Two types of inhibitory receptor superfamily members are immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)-bearing receptors and their non-ITIM-bearing, activating counterparts. Control of cell signaling via SHP-1 is thought to occur through a balance between PILRalpha-mediated inhibition and PILRbeta-mediated activation. These paired immunoglobulin-like receptor genes are located in a tandem head-to-tail orientation on chromosome 7. This particular gene encodes the ITIM-bearing member of the receptor pair, which functions in the inhibitory role. Alternative splicing has been observed at this locus and three variants, each encoding a distinct isoform, are described.

B4GALT1	P15291	ENSG00000086062	B4GALT1	P15291,Q86XA6	UDP-Gal:betaGlcNAc beta 1,4- galactosyltransferase, polypeptide 1	This gene is one of seven beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT) genes. They encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear to have exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose; all transfer galactose in a beta1,4 linkage to similar acceptor sugars: GlcNAc, Glc, and Xyl. Each beta4GalT has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to the Golgi apparatus and which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane anchor. By sequence similarity, the beta4GalTs form four groups: beta4GalT1 and beta4GalT2, beta4GalT3 and beta4GalT4, beta4GalT5 and beta4GalT6, and beta4GalT7. This gene is unique among the beta4GalT genes because it encodes an enzyme that participates both in glycoconjugate and lactose biosynthesis. For the first activity, the enzyme adds galactose to N-acetylglucosamine residues that are either monosaccharides or the nonreducing ends of glycoprotein carbohydrate chains. The second activity is restricted to lactating mammary tissues where the enzyme forms a heterodimer with alpha-lactalbumin to catalyze UDP-galactose + D-glucose <=> UDP + lactose. The two enzymatic forms result from alternate transcription initiation sites and post-translational processing. Two transcripts, which differ only at the 5' end, with approximate lengths of 4.1 kb and 3.9 kb encode the same protein. The longer transcript encodes the type II membrane-bound, trans-Golgi resident protein involved in glycoconjugate biosynthesis. The shorter transcript encodes a protein which is cleaved to form the soluble lactose synthase.

The type 2 cystatin proteins are a class of cysteine proteinase inhibitors found in a variety of human fluids and secretions, where they appear to provide protective functions. This gene encodes a cystatin from the type 2 family, which is down-regulated in metastatic breast tumor cells as compared to primary tumor cells. Loss of expression is likely associated with the progression of a primary tumor to a metastatic phenotype.

They have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, signaling, neurite outgrowth and metastasis. Laminins are composed of 3 non identical chains: laminin alpha, beta and gamma (formerly A, B1, and B2, respectively) and they form a cruciform structure consisting of 3 short arms, each formed by a different chain, and a long arm composed of all 3 chains. Each laminin chain is a multidomain protein encoded by a distinct gene. Several isoforms of each chain have been described. Different alpha, beta and gamma chain isomers combine to give rise to different heterotrimeric laminin isoforms which are designated by Arabic numerals in the order of their discovery, i.e. alpha1beta1gamma1 heterotrimer is laminin 1. The biological functions of the different chains and trimer molecules are largely unknown, but some of the chains have been shown to differ with respect to their tissue distribution, presumably reflecting diverse functions in vivo. This gene encodes the alpha chain isoform laminin, alpha 4. The domain structure of alpha 4 is similar to that of alpha 3, both of which resemble truncated versions of alpha 1 and alpha 2, in that approximately 1,200 residues at the N-terminus (domains IV, V and VI) have been lost. Laminin, alpha 4 contains the C-terminal G domain which distinguishes all alpha chains from the beta and gamma chains. The RNA analysis from adult and fetal tissues revealed developmental regulation of expression, however, the exact function of laminin, alpha 4 is not known. Tissue-specific utilization of alternative polyA-signal has been described in literature. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.

May also play its inhibitory role independently of SH2-containing phosphatases. Modulates cytokine production in CD4+ T-cells, down-regulating IL2 and IFNG production while inducing secretion of transforming growth factor beta. Down-regulates also IgG and IgE production in B-cells as well as IL8, IL10 and TNF secretion. Inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cell lines as well as prevents nuclear translocation of NF-kappa-B p65 subunit/RELA and phosphorylation of I-kappa-B alpha/CHUK in these cells.

The encoded protein is involved in the innate immune system and recognizes numerous evolutionarily divergent pathogens ranging from parasites to viruses with a large impact on public health. The protein is organized into three distinct domains: an N-terminal transmembrane domain, a tandem-repeat neck domain and C-type lectin carbohydrate recognition domain. The extracellular region consisting of the C-type lectin and neck domains has a dual function as a pathogen recognition receptor and a cell adhesion receptor by binding carbohydrate ligands on the surface of microbes and endogenous cells. The neck region is important for homo-oligomerization which allows the receptor to bind multivalent ligands with high avidity. Variations in the number of 23 amino acid repeats in the neck domain of this protein are rare but have a significant impact on ligand binding ability. This gene is closely related in terms of both sequence and function to a neighboring gene (GeneID 10332; often referred to as L-SIGN). DC-SIGN and L-SIGN differ in their ligand-binding properties and distribution.

TPSAB1	Q15661	ENSG00000172236	TPSAB1	Q15661,J3QTS8,A0A0C4DGM1	tryptase alpha/beta 1	Tryptases comprise a family of trypsin-like serine proteases, the peptidase family S1. Tryptases are enzymatically active only as heparin-stabilized tetramers, and they are resistant to all known endogenous proteinase inhibitors. Several tryptase genes are clustered on chromosome 16p13.3. These genes are characterized by several distinct features. They have a highly conserved 3' UTR and contain tandem repeat sequences at the 5' flank and 3' UTR which are thought to play a role in regulation of the mRNA stability. These genes have an intron immediately upstream of the initiator Met codon, which separates the site of transcription initiation from protein coding sequence. This feature is characteristic of tryptases but is unusual in other genes. The alleles of this gene exhibit an unusual amount of sequence variation, such that the alleles were once thought to represent two separate genes, alpha and beta 1. Beta tryptases appear to be the main isoenzymes expressed in mast cells; whereas in basophils, alpha tryptases predominate. Tryptases have been implicated as mediators in the pathogenesis of asthma and other allergic and inflammatory disorders. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]	107	Tryptase alpha/beta-1 (Tryptase-1)	TPSAB1	Tryptase is the major neutral protease present in mast cells and is secreted upon the coupled activation-degranulation response of this cell type.

FGF family members bind heparin and possess broad mitogenic and angiogenic activities. This protein has been implicated in diverse biological processes, such as limb and nervous system development, wound healing, and tumor growth. The mRNA for this gene contains multiple polyadenylation sites, and is alternatively translated from non-AUG (CUG) and AUG initiation codons, resulting in five different isoforms with distinct properties. The CUG-initiated isoforms are localized in the nucleus and are responsible for the intracrine effect, whereas, the AUG-initiated form is mostly cytosolic and is responsible for the paracrine and autocrine effects of this FGF.

The TRIM motif includes three zinc-binding domains, a RING, a B-box type 1 and a B-box type 2, and a coiled-coil region. The protein forms homo-oligomers via the coilel-coil region and localizes to cytoplasmic bodies. It appears to function as a E3 ubiquitin-ligase and ubiqutinates itself to regulate its subcellular localization. It may play a role in retroviral restriction. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2009]	124	Tripartite motif-containing protein 5	TRIM5	Capsid-specific restriction factor that prevents infection from non-host-adapted retroviruses. Blocks viral replication early in the life cycle, after viral entry but before reverse transcription. In addition to acting as a capsid-specific restriction factor, also acts as a pattern recognition receptor that activates innate immune signaling in response to the retroviral capsid lattice. Binding to the viral capsid triggers its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and in concert with the heterodimeric ubiquitin conjugating enzyme complex UBE2V1-UBE2N (also known as UBC13-UEV1A complex) generates 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains, which in turn are catalysts in the autophosphorylation of the MAP3K7/TAK1 complex (includes TAK1, TAB2, and TAB3). Activation of the MAP3K7/TAK1 complex by autophosphorylation results in the induction and expression of NF-kappa-B and MAPK-responsive inflammatory genes, thereby leading to an innate immune response in the infected cell. Restricts infection by N-tropic murine leukemia virus (N-MLV), equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) (PubMed:17156811). Plays a role in regulating autophagy through activation of autophagy regulator BECN1 by causing its dissociation from its inhibitors BCL2 and TAB2 (PubMed:25127057). Also plays a role in autophagy by acting as a selective autophagy receptor which recognizes and targets HIV-1 capsid protein p24 for autophagic destruction (PubMed:25127057).	56338	Cytoplasm,Cytoplasm,P-body,Nucleus	Biological process - Antiviral defense,Biological process - Autophagy,Biological process - Immunity,Biological process - Innate immunity,Biological process - Ubl conjugation pathway,Biological process - Host-virus interaction,Cellular component - Nucleus,Cellular component - Cytoplasm,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Domain - Coiled coil,Domain - Zinc-finger,Ligand - Metal-binding,Ligand - Zinc,Molecular function - Ligase,PTM - Acetylation,PTM - Phosphoprotein,PTM - Ubl conjugation,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Reference proteome	IR 	Predicted intracellular proteins	Mixed			Immune System	GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0009058 - biosynthetic process;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0007166 - cell surface receptor signaling pathway;GO:0044085 - cellular component biogenesis;GO:0016043 - cellular component organization;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0071345 - cellular response to cytokine stimulus;GO:0019221 - cytokine-mediated signaling pathway;GO:0051607 - defense response to virus;GO:0006955 - immune response;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0045087 - innate immune response;GO:0035556 - intracellular signal transduction;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0000165 - MAPK cascade;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0016310 - phosphorylation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0010468 - regulation of gene expression;GO:0050776 - regulation of immune response;GO:0045088 - regulation of innate immune response;GO:0042325 - regulation of phosphorylation;GO:0034341 - response to interferon-gamma;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0007165 - signal transduction	GO:0043167 - ion binding;GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0005737 - cytoplasm;GO:0000932 - cytoplasmic mRNA processing body;GO:0005829 - cytosol;GO:0005634 - nucleus

EGLN1	Q9GZT9	ENSG00000135766	EGLN1	Q9GZT9	egl-9 family hypoxia-inducible factor 1	The protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the post-translational formation of 4-hydroxyproline in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha proteins. HIF is a transcriptional complex that plays a central role in mammalian oxygen homeostasis. This protein functions as a cellular oxygen sensor, and under normal oxygen concentration, modification by prolyl hydroxylation is a key regulatory event that targets HIF subunits for proteasomal destruction via the von Hippel-Lindau ubiquitylation complex. Mutations in this gene are associated with erythrocytosis familial type 3 (ECYT3). [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2009]	139	Egl nine homolog 1	EGLN1	Cellular oxygen sensor that catalyzes, under normoxic conditions, the post-translational formation of 4-hydroxyproline in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha proteins. Hydroxylates a specific proline found in each of the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domains (N-terminal, NODD, and C-terminal, CODD) of HIF1A. Also hydroxylates HIF2A. Has a preference for the CODD site for both HIF1A and HIF1B. Hydroxylated HIFs are then targeted for proteasomal degradation via the von Hippel-Lindau ubiquitination complex. Under hypoxic conditions, the hydroxylation reaction is attenuated allowing HIFs to escape degradation resulting in their translocation to the nucleus, heterodimerization with HIF1B, and increased expression of hypoxy-inducible genes. EGLN1 is the most important isozyme under normoxia and, through regulating the stability of HIF1, involved in various hypoxia-influenced processes such as angiogenesis in retinal and cardiac functionality. Target proteins are preferentially recognized via a LXXLAP motif.	46021	Cytoplasm,Nucleus	Cellular component - Nucleus,Cellular component - Cytoplasm,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Disease - Disease mutation,Disease - Congenital erythrocytosis,Domain - Zinc-finger,Ligand - Iron,Ligand - Metal-binding,Ligand - Vitamin C,Ligand - Zinc,Molecular function - Dioxygenase,Molecular function - Oxidoreductase,PTM - Acetylation,PTM - Phosphoprotein,PTM - S-nitrosylation,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Reference proteome	IR 	Disease related genes, Enzymes, Plasma proteins, Potential drug targets, Predicted intracellular proteins	Expressed in all			Cellular responses to stress	GO:0001525 - angiogenesis;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0009058 - biosynthetic process;GO:0048514 - blood vessel morphogenesis;GO:0009056 - catabolic process;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0071456 - cellular response to hypoxia;GO:0033554 - cellular response to stress;GO:0048878 - chemical homeostasis;GO:0032502 - developmental process;GO:0007507 - heart development;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0010468 - regulation of gene expression;GO:0000003 - reproduction;GO:0001666 - response to hypoxia;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress	GO:0030246 - carbohydrate binding;GO:0043167 - ion binding;GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0005737 - cytoplasm;GO:0005829 - cytosol;GO:0005634 - nucleus

Also involved in transepithelial migration of leukocytes through adhesive interactions with JAML a transmembrane protein of the plasma membrane of leukocytes. The interaction between both receptors also mediates the activation of gamma-delta T-cells, a subpopulation of T-cells residing in epithelia and involved in tissue homeostasis and repair. Upon epithelial CXADR-binding, JAML induces downstream cell signaling events in gamma-delta T-cells through PI3-kinase and MAP kinases. It results in proliferation and production of cytokines and growth factors by T-cells that in turn stimulate epithelial tissues repair.,(Microbial infection) Acts as a receptor for adenovirus type C (PubMed:9733828, PubMed:10666333, PubMed:12297051, PubMed:10567268).

This protein contains an SH2 domain and a short tail. It associates with the signaling lymphocyte-activation molecule, thereby acting as an inhibitor of this transmembrane protein by blocking the recruitment of the SH2-domain-containing signal-transduction molecule SHP-2 to its docking site. This protein can also bind to other related surface molecules that are expressed on activated T, B and NK cells, thereby modifying signal transduction pathways in these cells. Mutations in this gene cause lymphoproliferative syndrome X-linked type 1 or Duncan disease, a rare immunodeficiency characterized by extreme susceptibility to infection with Epstein-Barr virus, with symptoms including severe mononucleosis and malignant lymphoma. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

In SLAM signaling seems to cooperate with SH2D1B/EAT-2. Initially it has been proposed that association with SLAMF1 prevents SLAMF1 binding to inhibitory effectors including INPP5D/SHIP1 and PTPN11/SHP-2 (PubMed:11806999). However, by simultaneous interactions, recruits FYN which subsequently phosphorylates and activates SLAMF1 (PubMed:12458214). Positively regulates CD244/2B4- and CD84-mediated natural killer (NK) cell functions. Can also promote CD48-, SLAMF6 -, LY9-, and SLAMF7-mediated NK cell activation. In the context of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity enhances conjugate formation with target cells (By similarity). May also regulate the activity of the neurotrophin receptors NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3.	14187	Cytoplasm	Biological process - Immunity,Biological process - Innate immunity,Biological process - Adaptive immunity,Cellular component - Cytoplasm,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Disease - Disease mutation,Domain - SH2 domain,PTM - Acetylation,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Reference proteome	IR 	Disease related genes, Plasma proteins, Predicted intracellular proteins	Tissue enhanced	lymph node: 28.5	phosphatase; hydrolase	Immune System	GO:0002250 - adaptive immune response;GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0001906 - cell killing;GO:0006959 - humoral immune response;GO:0006955 - immune response;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0045087 - innate immune response;GO:0001909 - leukocyte mediated cytotoxicity;GO:0002228 - natural killer cell mediated immunity;GO:0050776 - regulation of immune response;GO:0045088 - regulation of innate immune response;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress	GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0005737 - cytoplasm;GO:0005829 - cytosol

[provided by RefSeq, Sep 2014]	177	Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1)	CXCL12	Chemoattractant active on T-lymphocytes, monocytes, but not neutrophils. Activates the C-X-C chemokine receptor CXCR4 to induce a rapid and transient rise in the level of intracellular calcium ions and chemotaxis. Also binds to atypical chemokine receptor ACKR3, which activates the beta-arrestin pathway and acts as a scavenger receptor for SDF-1. SDF-1-beta(3-72) and SDF-1-alpha(3-67) show a reduced chemotactic activity. Binding to cell surface proteoglycans seems to inhibit formation of SDF-1-alpha(3-67) and thus to preserve activity on local sites. Acts as a positive regulator of monocyte migration and a negative regulator of monocyte adhesion via the LYN kinase. Stimulates migration of monocytes and T-lymphocytes through its receptors, CXCR4 and ACKR3, and decreases monocyte adherence to surfaces coated with ICAM-1, a ligand for beta-2 integrins.

This protein forms a receptor complex with interleukine 10 receptor, beta (IL10RB). The receptor complex has been shown to interact with three closely related cytokines, including interleukin 28A (IL28A), interleukin 28B (IL28B), and interleukin 29 (IL29). The expression of all three cytokines can be induced by viral infection. The cells overexpressing this protein have been found to have enhanced responses to IL28A and IL29, but decreased response to IL28B. Three alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]	179	Interferon lambda receptor 1 (IFN-lambda receptor 1)	IFNLR1	The IFNLR1/IL10RB dimer is a receptor for the cytokine ligands IFNL2 and IFNL3 and mediates their antiviral activity. The ligand/receptor complex stimulate the activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway leading to the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG), which contribute to the antiviral state. Determines the cell type specificity of the lambda interferon action. Shows a more restricted pattern of expression in the epithelial tissues thereby limiting responses to lambda interferons primarily to epithelial cells of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive tracts. Seems not to be essential for early virus-activated host defense in vaginal infection, but plays an important role in Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced antiviral defense. Plays a significant role in the antiviral immune defense in the intestinal epithelium.	57653	Membrane	Biological process - Antiviral defense,Cellular component - Membrane,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Domain - Signal,Domain - Transmembrane,Domain - Transmembrane helix,Molecular function - Receptor,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Reference proteome	IR 	Predicted membrane proteins, Predicted secreted proteins	Mixed		defense/immunity protein; receptor		GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0007154 - cell communication;GO:0008283 - cell proliferation;GO:0007166 - cell surface receptor signaling pathway;GO:0071345 - cellular response to cytokine stimulus;GO:0019221 - cytokine-mediated signaling pathway;GO:0051607 - defense response to virus;GO:0006955 - immune response;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0045087 - innate immune response;GO:0042127 - regulation of cell proliferation;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0034342 - response to type III interferon;GO:0007165 - signal transduction		GO:0016021 - integral component of membrane;GO:0032002 - interleukin-28 receptor complex;GO:0005886 - plasma membrane

The complement pathway plays an essential role in the innate and adaptive immune response. The encoded protein is synthesized as a zymogen and is activated when it complexes with the pathogen recognition molecules of lectin pathway, the mannose-binding lectin and the ficolins. This protein is not directly involved in complement activation but may play a role as an amplifier of complement activation by cleaving complement C2 or by activating another complement serine protease, MASP-2. The encoded protein is also able to cleave fibrinogen and factor XIII and may may be involved in coagulation. A splice variant of this gene which lacks the serine protease domain functions as an inhibitor of the complement pathway. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Apr 2010]	183	Mannan-binding lectin serine protease 1	MASP1	Functions in the lectin pathway of complement, which performs a key role in innate immunity by recognizing pathogens through patterns of sugar moieties and neutralizing them.

Functions as an endopeptidase and may activate MASP2 or C2 or directly activate C3 the key component of complement reaction. Isoform 2 may have an inhibitory effect on the activation of the lectin pathway of complement or may cleave IGFBP5.	79247	Secreted	Biological process - Immunity,Biological process - Innate immunity,Biological process - Complement activation lectin pathway,Cellular component - Secreted,Coding sequence diversity - Alternative splicing,Coding sequence diversity - Polymorphism,Disease - Disease mutation,Domain - EGF-like domain,Domain - Repeat,Domain - Signal,Domain - Sushi,Ligand - Calcium,Ligand - Metal-binding,Molecular function - Hydrolase,Molecular function - Protease,Molecular function - Serine protease,PTM - Autocatalytic cleavage,PTM - Glycoprotein,PTM - Hydroxylation,PTM - Disulfide bond,Technical term - 3D-structure,Technical term - Complete proteome,Technical term - Direct protein sequencing,Technical term - Reference proteome	IR 	Disease related genes, Enzymes, Plasma proteins, Potential drug targets, Predicted intracellular proteins, Predicted secreted proteins	Tissue enhanced	heart muscle: 60.0;liver: 60.2	protease; hydrolase	Immune System; Vesicle-mediated transport	GO:0065007 - biological regulation;GO:0044237 - cellular metabolic process;GO:0006956 - complement activation;GO:0006959 - humoral immune response;GO:0006955 - immune response;GO:0002376 - immune system process;GO:0006954 - inflammatory response;GO:0045087 - innate immune response;GO:0051179 - localization;GO:0008152 - metabolic process;GO:0006508 - proteolysis;GO:0050794 - regulation of cellular process;GO:0010468 - regulation of gene expression;GO:0050776 - regulation of immune response;GO:0050896 - response to stimulus;GO:0006950 - response to stress;GO:0006810 - transport	GO:0016787 - hydrolase activity;GO:0043167 - ion binding;GO:0005515 - protein binding	GO:0005576 - extracellular region;GO:0005615 - extracellular space

[provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]	187	Probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX58	DDX58	Innate immune receptor which acts as a cytoplasmic sensor of viral nucleic acids and plays a major role in sensing viral infection and in the activation of a cascade of antiviral responses including the induction of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines. Its ligands include: 5'-triphosphorylated ssRNA and dsRNA and short dsRNA (<1 kb in length). In addition to the 5'-triphosphate moiety, blunt-end base pairing at the 5'-end of the RNA is very essential. Overhangs at the non-triphosphorylated end of the dsRNA RNA have no major impact on its activity. A 3'overhang at the 5'triphosphate end decreases and any 5'overhang at the 5' triphosphate end abolishes its activity. Upon ligand binding it associates with mitochondria antiviral signaling protein (MAVS/IPS1) which activates the IKK-related kinases: TBK1 and IKBKE which phosphorylate interferon regulatory factors: IRF3 and IRF7 which in turn activate transcription of antiviral immunological genes, including interferons (IFNs); IFN-alpha and IFN-beta. Detects both positive and negative strand RNA viruses including members of the families Paramyxoviridae: Human respiratory syncytial virus and measles virus (MeV), Rhabdoviridae: vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Orthomyxoviridae: influenza A and B virus, Flaviviridae: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus (DENV) and west Nile virus (WNV).

TOP2B	Q02880	ENSG00000077097	TOP2B	Q02880,Q02880,E9PCY5	topoisomerase (DNA) II beta	This gene encodes a DNA topoisomerase, an enzyme that controls and alters the topologic states of DNA during transcription. This nuclear enzyme is involved in processes such as chromosome condensation, chromatid separation, and the relief of torsional stress that occurs during DNA transcription and replication. It catalyzes the transient breaking and rejoining of two strands of duplex DNA which allows the strands to pass through one another, thus altering the topology of DNA. Two forms of this enzyme exist as likely products of a gene duplication event. The gene encoding this form, beta, is localized to chromosome 3 and the alpha form is localized to chromosome 17. The gene encoding this enzyme functions as the target for several anticancer agents and a variety of mutations in this gene have been associated with the development of drug resistance. Reduced activity of this enzyme may also play a role in ataxia-telangiectasia. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants; however, the second variant has not yet been fully described.

This subunit may be a positive regulator of AMPK activity. The myristoylation and phosphorylation of this subunit have been shown to affect the enzyme activity and cellular localization of AMPK. This subunit may also serve as an adaptor molecule mediating the association of the AMPK complex.

However, it does bind specific voltage-gated potassium channels and alters their expression and biophysical properties. Variations in this gene may be associated with susceptibility to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation.

This gene product is thought to be involved in DNA double-strand break repair and DNA damage-induced checkpoint activation. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]	164	Nibrin	NBN	Component of the MRE11-RAD50-NBN (MRN complex) which plays a critical role in the cellular response to DNA damage and the maintenance of chromosome integrity. The complex is involved in double-strand break (DSB) repair, DNA recombination, maintenance of telomere integrity, cell cycle checkpoint control and meiosis. The complex possesses single-strand endonuclease activity and double-strand-specific 3'-5' exonuclease activity, which are provided by MRE11A. RAD50 may be required to bind DNA ends and hold them in close proximity. NBN modulate the DNA damage signal sensing by recruiting PI3/PI4-kinase family members ATM, ATR, and probably DNA-PKcs to the DNA damage sites and activating their functions. It can also recruit MRE11 and RAD50 to the proximity of DSBs by an interaction with the histone H2AX. NBN also functions in telomere length maintenance by generating the 3' overhang which serves as a primer for telomerase dependent telomere elongation. NBN is a major player in the control of intra-S-phase checkpoint and there is some evidence that NBN is involved in G1 and G2 checkpoints. The roles of NBS1/MRN encompass DNA damage sensor, signal transducer, and effector, which enable cells to maintain DNA integrity and genomic stability. Forms a complex with RBBP8 to link DNA double-strand break sensing to resection.

CRH	P06850	ENSG00000147571	CRH	P06850	corticotropin releasing hormone	This gene encodes a member of the corticotropin-releasing factor family. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature neuropeptide hormone. In response to stress, this hormone is secreted by the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, binds to corticotropin releasing hormone receptors and stimulates the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone from the pituitary gland. Marked reduction in this protein has been observed in association with Alzheimer's disease. Autosomal recessive hypothalamic corticotropin deficiency has multiple and potentially fatal metabolic consequences including hypoglycemia and hepatitis. In addition to production in the hypothalamus, this protein is also synthesized in peripheral tissues, such as T lymphocytes, and is highly expressed in the placenta. In the placenta it is a marker that determines the length of gestation and the timing of parturition and delivery. A rapid increase in circulating levels of the hormone occurs at the onset of parturition, suggesting that, in addition to its metabolic functions, this protein may act as a trigger for parturition.
